There are various views on the existence and meaning of such rites. Many Christians consider the sacraments to be a visible symbol of the reality of God, as well as a means by which God enacts his grace. Many denominations, including the Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Reformed, hold to the definition of sacrament formulated by Augustine of Hippo: an outward sign of an inward grace that has been instituted by Jesus Christ. Sacraments signify God's grace in a way that is outwardly observable to the participant. The Catholic Church and the Old Catholic Church recognise seven sacraments: Baptism, Reconciliation (Penance or Confession), Eucharist (or Holy Communion), Confirmation, Marriage (Matrimony), Holy Orders, and Anointing of the Sick (Extreme Unction). The Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox Church also believe that there are seven major sacraments, but apply the corresponding Greek word, \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (\"mysterion\") also to rites that in the Western tradition are called sacramentals and to other realities, such as the Church itself. Many Protestant denominations, such as those within the Reformed tradition, identify two sacraments instituted by Christ, the Eucharist (or Holy Communion) and Baptism. | wikipage: Sacrament text: The Church teaches that the effect of the sacraments comes \"ex opere operato\", by the very fact of being administered, regardless of the personal holiness of the minister administering it. However, as indicated in this definition of the sacraments given by the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\", a recipient's own lack of proper disposition to receive the grace conveyed can block a sacrament's effectiveness in that person. The sacraments presuppose faith and through their words and ritual elements, nourish, strengthen and give expression to faith. Though not every individual has to receive every sacrament, the Church affirms that, for believers as a whole, the sacraments are necessary for salvation, as the modes of grace divinely instituted by Christ himself. Through each of them, Christ bestows that sacrament's particular grace, such as incorporation into Christ and the Church, forgiveness of sins, or consecration for a particular service. The Eastern Orthodox tradition does not limit the number of sacraments to seven, holding that anything the Church does as Church is in some sense sacramental. However it recognizes these seven as \"the major sacraments\", which are completed by many other blessings and special services. Some lists of the sacraments taken from the Church Fathers include the consecration of a church, monastic tonsure, and the burial of the dead.",

The world's first movable type printing press technology for printing paper books was made of porcelain materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the Northern Song Dynasty by the inventor Bi Sheng (990\u20131051). Subsequently in 1377, the world's oldest extant movable metal print book, Jikji, was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty. Because of this, the diffusion of both movable-type systems was, to some degree, limited to primarily East Asia, although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries, traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years; and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe. Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg introduced the metal movable-type printing press in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould. | wikipage: Printing text: Eastern metal movable type was spread to Europe between the late 14th century and the early 15th century. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg introduced the first movable type printing system in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting type based on a matrix and hand mould, adaptations to the screw-press, the use of an oil-based ink, and the creation of a softer and more absorbent paper.

The world's first movable type printing press technology for printing paper books was made of porcelain materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the Northern Song Dynasty by the inventor Bi Sheng (990\u20131051). Subsequently in 1377, the world's oldest extant movable metal print book, Jikji, was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty. Because of this, the diffusion of both movable-type systems was, to some degree, limited to primarily East Asia, although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries, traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years; and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe. Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg introduced the metal movable-type printing press in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould.",

It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton and multi-instrumentalist Sam Farrar. Original members Levine, Carmichael, Madden and drummer Ryan Dusick first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in high school. After self-releasing their independent album \"We Like Digging? \", the band signed to Reprise Records and released the album \"The Fourth World\" in 1997. The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college. In 2001, the band remerged as Maroon 5, pursuing a different direction and adding guitarist Valentine. The band signed with a subsidiary of J Records, Octone Records, and released their debut album \"Songs About Jane\" in June 2002. Aided by its lead single \"Harder to Breathe\", which received heavy airplay, the album peaked at number six on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, and went platinum in 2004. The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. In 2006, Dusick left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn.",

The so-called \"whiskey tax\" was the first tax imposed on a domestic product by the newly formed federal government. It became law in 1791, and was intended to generate revenue for the war debt incurred during the Revolutionary War. The tax applied to all distilled spirits, but American whiskey was by far the country's most popular distilled beverage in the 18th century, so the excise became widely known as a \"whiskey tax\". Farmers of the western frontier were accustomed to distilling their surplus rye, barley, wheat, corn, or fermented grain mixtures into whiskey. These farmers resisted the tax. In these regions, whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. Many of the resisters were war veterans who believed that they were fighting for the principles of the American Revolution, in particular against taxation without local representation, while the federal government maintained that the taxes were the legal expression of Congressional taxation powers.

To protect American shipping from Barbary pirates and other threats, he re-established the United States Navy with the Naval Act of 1794.

Washington commanded a militia force of 12,950 men and, through a clear show of federal authority, established the principle that federal law is the supreme law of the land. In the Battle of Bladensburg, sitting president James Madison and most of the rest of the federal government were present on the field of battle and were very nearly captured. President Madison escaped capture, fleeing to Virginia by horseback in the aftermath of the battle, but the British burned Washington and other buildings .The charred remains of the capital by the British were a humiliating defeat for Madison and America."

Produced by David Cole and Robert Clivill\u00e9s of C+C Music Factory, Dayne's \"Can't Get Enough of Your Love\" became a smash dance club hit, peaking at number two.",

The final design of George Wittet was sanctioned in 1914 and the construction of the monument was completed in 1924. The Gateway was later used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and the new Governors of Bombay. It served to allow entry and access to India. The Gateway of India is located on the waterfront at Apollo Bunder area at the end of \" Chatrapathi Shivaji Maharaj Marg\" in South Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea. The monument has also been referred to as the Taj Mahal of Mumbai, and is the city's top tourist attraction.

The second practising Jew to be a member of the British cabinet (the first being Herbert Samuel, who was also a member of H. H. Asquith's government), Isaacs was the first Jew to be Lord Chief Justice, and the first, and as yet only, British Jew to be raised to a marquessate. Isaacs was born in London, the son of a Jewish fruit importer at Spitalfields. He was educated at University College School and then entered the family business at the age of 15. In 1876\u201377 he served as a ship's boy and later worked as a jobber on the stock-exchange from 1880\u201384. Isaacs was admitted as a student to the Middle Temple in 1885, and was called to the Bar in 1887. He set up his own chambers at 1 Garden Court, Temple, and was very successful; within five years he was able to repay his creditors, and after twenty years at the bar earned the enormous sum of \u00a330,000 per year. | wikipage: Gateway of India text: The foundation stone was laid on March 31, 1913 by the governor of Bombay, Sir George Sydenham Clarke with the final design of George Wittet sanctioned on March 31, 1914. The land on which the Gateway was built on was previously a \"crude jetty\", used by the fishing community which was later renovated and used as a landing place for British governors and other prominent people. In earlier times, it would have been the first structure that visitors arriving by boat in Mumbai would have seen. Between 1915 and 1919, work proceeded at Apollo Bundar (Port) to reclaim the land on which the gateway and the new sea wall would be built.

            "The final design for the Gateway of India was done by the Scottish architect, George Wittet. It combines elements of the Roman triumphal arch and 16th-century architecture of Gujarat. The architecture also combines indigenous architectural elements with elements of Islamic architecture, known as the Indo-Saracenic. Gammon India had undertaken construction work for the gateway. The foundation stone for the gateway was laid on 31 March 1913 by then governor of Bombay, Sir George Sydenham Clarke. Building period was from 31 March 1913-1928. The gateway was opened to the public on 4 December 1924 by then viceroy, Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading."

The final design of George Wittet was sanctioned in 1914 and the construction of the monument was completed in 1924. The Gateway was later used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and the new Governors of Bombay. It served to allow entry and access to India. The Gateway of India is located on the waterfront at Apollo Bunder area at the end of \" Chatrapathi Shivaji Maharaj Marg\" in South Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea. The monument has also been referred to as the Taj Mahal of Mumbai, and is the city's top tourist attraction.

            "In baseball, the strikeout is a statistic used to evaluate pitchers. There are several players with a claim to the single-season strikeout record. Among recognized major leagues, Matt Kilroy accumulated the highest single-season total, with 513 strikeouts for the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association in 1886. However, his name does not appear on Major League Baseball's single-season leaders list, since the American Association was independent of the constituent leagues that currently make up Major League Baseball. In the National League, Charles \"Old Hoss\" Radbourn struck out 441 batters for the Providence Grays; however, the Providence franchise folded after the 1885 season and has no successor. Therefore, Major League Baseball recognizes his runner-up from that season, Charlie Buffinton, as the record-holder with 417 strikeouts."

Some of the songs in question included modest hits such as \"When I'm Gone\" and \"Operator\". Holloway was planning to release her long-awaited second album, \"Hurtin' & Cryin,\" which had released \"Just Look What You've Done\" as the leading track, but for unknown reasons the record was shelved. Along with her sister Patrice, using music provided by Frank Wilson and with additional help from Gordy himself, Holloway co-wrote \"You've Made Me So Very Happy\". Coincidentally, Holloway recorded the song after a breakup with a boyfriend.",

Life imprisonment is mandatory for murder in South Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland, aircraft hijacking across Australia under the Civil Aviation Act 1988, and in the remaining states and territories for the murder of a police officer or public official. In New South Wales, the average prison term for murder is 25 years, despite the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) stating the maximum sentence to be for the remainder of the offender's 'natural life'. If a non-parole period is fixed, it must be at least 10 years unless exceptional circumstances exist, or 20 years if the prisoner is convicted of the murder of a police officer or other public official. The longest overall non-parole period is 60 years, being served by Dieter Pfennig (South Australia), who kidnapped and murdered 10-year-old Louise Bell in January 1983, kidnapped and murdered 10-year-old Michael Black in January 1989, and kidnapped and sexually abused a third child in December 1989.

Although the family home was in Lenah Valley, Tasmania, Bryant spent some of his childhood at their beach home in Carnarvon Bay, Tasmania. In a 2011 interview, his mother recalls that while he was very young, she would often find Martin's toys broken, and said he was an \"annoying\" and \"different\" child. A psychologist's view was that he would never hold down a job, as he would aggravate people to such an extent that he would always be in trouble.

Distinct from the family planning policies of most other countries (which focus on providing contraceptive options to help women have the number of children they want), it set a limit on the number of children parents could have, the world's most extreme example of population planning. It was introduced in 1979 (after a decade-long two-child policy), modified in the mid 1980s to allow rural parents a second child if the first was a daughter, and then lasted three more decades before being eliminated at the end of 2015. The policy also allowed exceptions for some other groups, including ethnic minorities. The term one-child policy is thus a misnomer, because for nearly 30 years of the 36 years that it existed (1979-2015) about half of all parents in China were allowed to have a second child. Provincial governments could (and did) require the use of contraception, sterilizations and abortions to ensure compliance and imposed enormous fines for violations.

In the early 1950s, the Chinese government made abortion illegal save when 1) the mother had a preexisting condition, such as tuberculosis or pernicious anemia, that would cause the pregnancy to be a threat to the mother's life; 2) when traditional Chinese medicine could not settle an overactive fetus and spontaneous abortion was expected; and 3) when the mother had already undergone two or more Caesarean sections. Punishments were written into the law for those who received or performed illegal abortions. In 1954 and 1956, the law was extended to include other pre-existing illnesses and disabilities, such as hypertension and epilepsy, as well as allowed women working in certain types of occupations to qualify.

The first lead computer generated character of the franchise, he has been portrayed by Ahmed Best in most of his appearances. Jar Jar's primary role in \"Episode I\" was to provide comic relief for the audience. He was met with an overwhelmingly negative reception from both critics and audiences, and is recognised as one of the most hated characters in \"Star Wars\" and the history of film in general. George Lucas was inspired to develop Jar Jar based on the Disney character Goofy. Singer Michael Jackson was originally considered for the role, but he wanted to portray the character using prosthetics while Lucas wanted him to be all CGI. Ahmed Best, who would end up playing the character, would later hypothesize that Lucas might have felt uncomfortable with the thought of the singer's casting overshadowing the actual movie; Best was chosen based on his work in the production of Stomp as Lucas wanted someone athletic for the role.",

Coal is valued for its energy content, and, since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine a pit, and the above-ground structures the \"pit head\". In Australia, \"colliery\" generally refers to an underground coal mine. In the United States, \"colliery\" has been used to describe a coal mine operation but nowadays the word is not commonly used. Coal mining has had many developments over the recent years, from the early days of men tunnelling, digging and manually extracting the coal on carts, to large open cut and long wall mines. Mining at this scale requires the use of draglines, trucks, conveyors, hydraulic jacks and shearers. Small-scale mining of surface deposits dates back thousands of years. For example, in Roman Britain, the Romans were exploiting most of the major coalfields by the late 2nd century AD. The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the 18th century and later spread to continental Europe and North America, was based on the availability of coal to power steam engines.",

Jack and the Beanstalk appeared as The Story of Jack Spriggins and the Enchanted Bean when it was published in London by J. Roberts in 1734. However, according to researchers at Durham University and Universidade Nova de Lisboa, the story is actually a Folk tale that originated more than five millennia ago. Jack and the Beanstalk is based on a wide-spread archaic story that is now classified by folklorists as ATU 328, The Boy Who Stole Ogre's Treasure.

They did not pay tribute nor were required to perform public service. The Florentine Codex gives information about how feather works were created. The amanteca had two ways of creating their works.

        "text": "question: What do brackets in an chemical equation mean? context: wikipage: Defining equation (physical chemistry) text: Defining equation (physical chemistry)\n\nIn physical chemistry, there are numerous quantities associated with chemical compounds and reactions; notably in terms of \"amounts\" of substance, \"activity\" or \"concentration\" of a substance, and the \"rate\" of reaction. This article uses SI units. Theoretical chemistry requires quantities from core physics, such as time, volume, temperature, and pressure. But the highly quantitative nature of physical chemistry, in a more specialized way than core physics, uses molar amounts of substance rather than simply counting numbers; this leads to the specialized definitions in this article. Core physics itself rarely uses the mole, except in areas overlapping thermodynamics and chemistry. \"Entity\" refers to the type of particle/s in question, such as atoms, molecules, complexes, radicals, ions, electrons etc. Conventionally for concentrations and activities, square brackets [ ] are used around the chemical molecular formula. For an arbitrary atom, generic letters in upright non-bold typeface such as A, B, R, X or Y etc. are often used. No standard symbols are used for the following quantities, as specifically applied to a substance:\n\n\nUsually the symbol for the quantity with a subscript of some reference to the quantity is used, or the quantity is written with the reference to the chemical in round brackets. | wikipage: Chemical formula text: A triple bond may be expressed with three lines (HC\u2261CH) or three pairs of dots (HC:::CH), and if there may be ambiguity, a single line or pair of dots may be used to indicate a single bond. Molecules with multiple functional groups that are the same may be expressed by enclosing the repeated group in round brackets. For example, isobutane may be written (CH)CH. This condensed structural formula implies a different connectivity from other molecules that can be formed using the same atoms in the same proportions (isomers). The formula (CH)CH implies a central carbon atom connected to one hydrogen atom and three CH groups. The same number of atoms of each element (10 hydrogens and 4 carbons, or CH) may be used to make a straight chain molecule, \"n\"-butane: CHCHCHCH. In any given chemical compound, the elements always combine in the same proportion with each other. This is the law of constant composition. The law of constant composition says that, in any particular chemical compound, all samples of that compound will be made up of the same elements in the same proportion or ratio. For example, any water molecule is always made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom in a 2:1 ratio. | wikipage: Chemical formula text: However, all these nomenclature systems go beyond the standards of chemical formulas, and technically are chemical naming systems, not formula systems. For polymers in condensed chemical formulas, parentheses are placed around the repeating unit.

This article uses SI units. Theoretical chemistry requires quantities from core physics, such as time, volume, temperature, and pressure. But the highly quantitative nature of physical chemistry, in a more specialized way than core physics, uses molar amounts of substance rather than simply counting numbers; this leads to the specialized definitions in this article. Core physics itself rarely uses the mole, except in areas overlapping thermodynamics and chemistry. \"Entity\" refers to the type of particle/s in question, such as atoms, molecules, complexes, radicals, ions, electrons etc. Conventionally for concentrations and activities, square brackets [ ] are used around the chemical molecular formula. For an arbitrary atom, generic letters in upright non-bold typeface such as A, B, R, X or Y etc. are often used. No standard symbols are used for the following quantities, as specifically applied to a substance:\n\n\nUsually the symbol for the quantity with a subscript of some reference to the quantity is used, or the quantity is written with the reference to the chemical in round brackets.",

Molecules with multiple functional groups that are the same may be expressed by enclosing the repeated group in round brackets. For example, isobutane may be written (CH)CH. This condensed structural formula implies a different connectivity from other molecules that can be formed using the same atoms in the same proportions (isomers). The formula (CH)CH implies a central carbon atom connected to one hydrogen atom and three CH groups. The same number of atoms of each element (10 hydrogens and 4 carbons, or CH) may be used to make a straight chain molecule, \"n\"-butane: CHCHCHCH. In any given chemical compound, the elements always combine in the same proportion with each other. This is the law of constant composition. The law of constant composition says that, in any particular chemical compound, all samples of that compound will be made up of the same elements in the same proportion or ratio. For example, any water molecule is always made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom in a 2:1 ratio.",

Barron reveals that he was about to gain Miss Peregrine's loop from Abe, but his hungry Hollow companion Mr. Malthus killed him before he could. Barron then posed as Dr. Golan and encouraged Jake to go to the island so he could find the loop. Using Jake as a hostage at the children's home, Barron forces Miss Peregrine to trap herself in bird form and takes her to Blackpool, leaving Jake, the children, and Miss Avocet as prey for Malthus. Malthus arrives and kills Miss Avocet, but Jake and the children escape just as the Luftwaffe bomb is about to destroy the house. Without Miss Peregrine to reset it, the house is destroyed and the loop closes, leaving Jake and the children stuck in 1943, but safe from Malthus, who is killed in the explosion. Rescuing a sunken ocean liner, they travel to Blackpool and enter its January 2016 loop, fight Barron's Wight and Hollow allies, and rescue Miss Peregrine and other captive Ymbrynes. Barron disguises himself as Jake, hoping to confuse the children who have come to finish him off.",

The all-time single-season record for the lowest ERA is held by Dutch Leonard, who in 1914 had an earned run average of 0.96, pitching 224.2 innings with a win-loss record of 19-5. The all-time record for the lowest single season earned run average by a pitcher pitching 300 or more innings is 1.12, set by Bob Gibson in 1968. The record for the lowest career earned run average is 1.82, held by Ed Walsh, who played from 1904 through 1917. Some researchers dissent from the official Major League Baseball record and claim that the pitcher with the all-time lowest earned run average is Tim Keefe, who had an earned run average of 0.86 in 1880 while appearing in 12 of his team's 83 games and pitching 105 innings (with a win-loss record of 6-6). But a purported record based on so few innings pitched is highly misleading. Over the years, more than a dozen part-time pitchers have pitched 105 or more innings and had an earned run average lower than 0.86. | wikipage: Earned run average text: Earned run average\n\nIn baseball statistics, earned run average (ERA) is the mean of earned runs given up by a pitcher per nine innings pitched (i.e. the traditional length of a game). It is determined by dividing the number of earned runs allowed by the number of innings pitched and multiplying by nine. Runs resulting from defensive errors (including pitchers' defensive errors) are recorded as unearned runs and omitted from ERA calculations. Henry Chadwick is credited with devising the statistic, which caught on as a measure of pitching effectiveness after relief pitching came into vogue in the 1900s. Prior to 1900\u2014and, in fact, for many years afterward\u2014pitchers were routinely expected to pitch a complete game, and their win-loss record was considered sufficient in determining their effectiveness. After pitchers like James Otis Crandall and Charley Hall made names for themselves as relief specialists, gauging a pitcher's effectiveness became more difficult using the traditional method of tabulating wins and losses. Some criterion was needed to capture the apportionment of earned-run responsibility for a pitcher in games that saw contributions from other pitchers for the same team. Since pitchers have primary responsibility for putting opposing batters out, they must assume responsibility when a batter they do not retire at the plate moves to base, and eventually reaches home, scoring a run. | wikipage: Earned run average text: Major League Baseball recognizes many records from the 19th century\u2014including Will White's 1879 record of 680 innings pitched, Charles Radbourne's 1884 record of 59 wins, and Pud Galvin's 1883 record for 75 games started, but does not recognize Keefe as the pitcher having the all-time lowest single season earned run average. Some sources may list players with infinite ERAs. This can happen if a pitcher allows one or more earned runs without retiring a batter (usually in a single appearance). Additionally, an undefined ERA occasionally occurs at the beginning of a baseball season. It is sometimes incorrectly displayed as zero or as the lowest ranking ERA, even though it is more akin to the highest. At times it can be misleading to judge relief pitchers solely on ERA, because they are charged only for runs scored by batters who reached base while batting against them. Thus, if a relief pitcher enters the game with his team leading by 1 run, with 2 outs and the bases loaded, and then gives up a single which scores 2 runs, he is not charged with those runs. If he retires the next batter (and pitches no more innings), his ERA for that game will be 0.00 despite having surrendered the lead. (He is likely recorded with a blown save.)",

Huge crowds viewed his coffin as he lay in state for two days in London. He is buried at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.

It is based on an event from the campaign by Assyrian king Sennacherib to capture Jerusalem, as described in the Bible (2 Kings 18\u201319, Isaiah 36\u201337). The poem is based on the biblical account of the historical Assyrian besieging of Jerusalem in 701 BC. The rhythm of the poem has a feel of the beat of a galloping horse's hooves (an anapestic tetrameter) as the Assyrian rides into battle. For clarification, YHWH here relates to God. The poem relates to the Biblical account of Sennacherib's attempted siege of Jerusalem. According to the story as related in 2 Kings, the Assyrian army came \"against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.\"",

A member of the Theridiidae family, this genus contains 31 species, including the North American black widows (\"L. mactans\", \"L. hesperus\", and \"L. variolus\"), the button spiders of Africa, and the Australian redback spider (\"L. hasseltii\"). Species vary widely in size. In most cases, the females are dark-coloured and readily identifiable by reddish markings on the abdomen, which are often hourglass-shaped. These small spiders have an unusually potent venom containing the neurotoxin latrotoxin, which causes the condition latrodectism, both named after the genus. Female widow spiders have unusually large venom glands and their bite can be particularly harmful to large vertebrates, including humans. Only the bites of the females are dangerous to humans. Despite their notoriety, \"Latrodectus\" bites are rarely fatal or even produce serious complications. Female widow spiders are typically dark brown or a shiny black in colour when they are full grown, usually exhibiting a red or orange hourglass on the ventral surface (underside) of the abdomen; some may have a pair of red spots or have no marking at all. | wikipage: Aname text: Aname\n\nThe spider genus Aname is endemic to Australia, with one species (\"Aname tasmanica\") found only on Tasmania. It contains the \"black wishbone spider\", \"A. atra\". Spiders in this genus, together with the related and very similar genera \"Chenistonia\" and \"Namea\", are called \"wishbone spiders\", for the shape of their open silk-lined burrow, which has the shape of the letter \"Y\", with one arm shorter than the other. Only the longer arm reaches the surface. The shorter arm is believed to allow the spider to survive flooding by trapping an air bubble. While \"Aname\" prefers dry open country and occurs throughout much of Australia (though mostly inland), \"Chenistonia\" occurs mostly in south and western Australia, and \"Namea\" is only known along the east coasts in rain forests.

Excel was not designed to be used as a database. Microsoft allows for a number of optional command-line switches to control the manner in which Excel starts. Excel 2016 has 484 functions. Of these, 360 existed prior to Excel 2010. Microsoft classifies these functions in 14 categories. Of the 484 current functions, 386 may be called from VBA as methods of the object \"WorksheetFunction\" and 44 have the same names as VBA functions.

Barnard performed the first transplant on Louis Washkansky on 3 December 1967 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town. Adrian Kantrowitz performed the first pediatric heart transplant on 6 December 1967 at Maimonides Hospital (now Maimonides Medical Center) in Brooklyn, New York, barely three days later. Shumway performed the first adult heart transplant in the United States on 6 January 1968 at Stanford University Hospital. Coronary artery bypass grafting, also called revascularization, is a common surgical procedure to create an alternative path to deliver blood supply to the heart and body, with the goal of preventing clot formation. This can be done in many ways, and the arteries used can be taken from several areas of the body. Arteries are typically harvested from the chest, arm, or wrist and then attached to a portion of the coronary artery, relieving pressure and limiting clotting factors in that area of the heart. The procedure is typically performed because of coronary artery disease (CAD), in which a plaque-like substance builds up in the coronary artery, the main pathway carrying oxygen-rich blood to the heart. | wikipage: Cardiac surgery text: Surgery on the great vessels (e.g., aortic coarctation repair, Blalock\u2013Thomas\u2013Taussig shunt creation, closure of patent ductus arteriosus) became common after the turn of the century. However, operations on the heart valves were unknown until, in 1925, Henry Souttar operated successfully on a young woman with mitral valve stenosis. He made an opening in the appendage of the left atrium and inserted a finger in order to palpate and explore the damaged mitral valve. The patient survived for several years, but Souttar's colleagues considered the procedure unjustified, and he could not continue. Alfred Blalock, Helen Taussig, and Vivien Thomas performed the first successful palliative pediatric cardiac operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital on November, 29 1944, in a one-year-old girl with Tetralogy of Fallot. Cardiac surgery changed significantly after World War II. In 1947, Thomas Sellors of Middlesex Hospital in London operated on a Tetralogy of Fallot patient with pulmonary stenosis and successfully divided the stenosed pulmonary valve. In 1948, Russell Brock, probably unaware of Sellors's work, used a specially designed dilator in three cases of pulmonary stenosis. | wikipage: Cardiac surgery text: Open-heart surgery is any kind of surgery in which a surgeon makes a large incision (cut) in the chest to open the rib cage and operate on the heart. \"Open\" refers to the chest, not the heart. Depending on the type of surgery, the surgeon also may open the heart. Dr. Wilfred G. Bigelow of the University of Toronto found that procedures involving opening the patient's heart could be performed better in a bloodless and motionless environment. Therefore, during such surgery, the heart is temporarily stopped, and the patient is placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, meaning a machine pumps their blood and oxygen. Because the machine cannot function the same way as the heart, surgeons try to minimize the time a patient spends on it. Cardiopulmonary bypass was developed after surgeons realized the limitations of hypothermia in cardiac surgery: Complex intracardiac repairs take time, and the patient needs blood flow to the body (particularly to the brain), as well as heart and lung function. In 1953, Dr. John Heysham Gibbon of Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia reported the first successful use of extracorporeal circulation by means of an oxygenator, but he abandoned the method after subsequent failures.",

As the war began to tilt against the Confederates, confidence in the currency diminished, and the government inflated the currency by continuing to print the unbacked banknotes. By the end of 1863, the Confederate dollar (or \"Greyback\", to distinguish it from the then-new \"Greenback\" paper US dollar, which was likewise put into circulation during the war) was quoted at just six cents in gold, and fell further still.

The conflict began in 1520, when expeditions of both kingdoms reached the Pacific Ocean, because no agreed meridian of longitude had been established in the orient. In 1494 Castile and Portugal signed the Treaty of Tordesillas, dividing the world into two areas of exploration and colonisation: the Castilian and the Portuguese. It proclaimed a meridian in the Atlantic Ocean, with areas west of the line exclusive to Spain, and east of the line to Portugal. In 1511, Malacca, then the centre of Asian trade, was conquered for Portugal by Afonso de Albuquerque. | wikipage: Treaty of Zaragoza text: Nevertheless, by 1542, King Charles V had decided to colonise the Philippines, assuming that Portugal would not protest too vigorously because the archipelago had no spices. Although he failed in his attempt, King Philip II succeeded in 1565, establishing the initial Spanish trading post at Manila. As his father had expected, there was little opposition from the Portuguese. | wikipage: Treaty of Zaragoza text: The treaty included a safeguard clause which stated that the deal would be undone if at any time the emperor wished to revoke it, with the Portuguese being reimbursed the money they had to pay, and each nation \"will have the right and the action as that is now.\" That never happened however, because the emperor desperately needed the Portuguese money to finance the War of the League of Cognac against his arch-rival Francis I of France. The treaty did not clarify or modify the line of demarcation established by the Treaty of Tordesillas, nor did it validate Spain's claim to equal hemispheres (180\u00b0 each), so the two lines divided the Earth into unequal portions. Portugal's portion was roughly 191\u00b0 of the Earth's circumference, whereas Spain's portion was roughly 169\u00b0. There was a \u00b14\u00b0 margin of uncertainty as to the exact size of both portions, due to the variation of opinion about the precise location of the Tordesillas line. Under the treaty, Portugal gained control of all lands and seas west of the line, including all of Asia and its neighbouring islands so far \"discovered\", leaving Spain with most of the Pacific Ocean. Although the Philippines was not mentioned in the treaty, Spain implicitly relinquished any claim to it because it was well west of the line.",

Several desalination plants were built in Australia between 1960 and 1980, especially following the revolution in membrane technology that made reverse osmosis economically viable, but vapor-compression desalination and multi-stage flash distillation plants were also built. By 2002, however, only two reverse osmosis desalination plants were still operating, one on Kangaroo Island and the other on Rottnest Island. Seawater reverse osmosis is the only type of desalination technology currently used for large-scale desalination plants in Australia, the most important of these plants being located in Perth and Sydney. Compared to existing sources, desalination is considered to be expensive, but research is underway to develop more effective desalination technology. Despite its drawbacks, it is considered a possible solution to the country's water shortages. Australia is the driest inhabitable continent on earth and its installed desalination capacity is around 1% of the total world\u2019s desalination capacity. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has considered several desalination technologies processes in Australia:\n\nA solar powered desalination unit designed for remote communities has been tested in the Northern Territory. | wikipage: Vapor-compression desalination text: Vapor-compression desalination\n\nVapor-compression desalination (VC) refers to a distillation process where the evaporation of sea or saline water is obtained by the application of heat delivered by compressed vapor. Since compression of the vapor increases both the pressure and temperature of the vapor, it is possible to use the latent heat rejected during condensation to generate additional vapor. The effect of compressing water vapor can be done by two methods. The first method utilizes an ejector system motivated by steam at manometric pressure from an external source in order to recycle vapor from the desalination process. The form is designated ejectocompression or thermocompression. Using the second method, water vapor is compressed by means of a mechanical device, electrically driven in most cases. This form is designated mechanical vapor compression (MVC). The MVC process comprises two different versions: vapor compression (VC) and vacuum vapor compression (VVC). VC designates those systems in which the evaporation effect takes place at manometric pressure, and VVC the systems in which evaporation takes place at sub-atmospheric pressures (under vacuum). The compression is mechanically powered by something such as a compression turbine. As vapor is generated, it is passed over to a heat exchanging condenser which returns the vapor to water. | wikipage: Multi-stage flash distillation text: Multi-stage flash distillation\n\nMulti-stage flash distillation (MSF) is a water desalination process that distills sea water by flashing a portion of the water into steam in multiple stages of what are essentially countercurrent heat exchangers. Multi-stage flash distillation plants produce about 60% of all desalinated water in the world. The plant has a series of spaces called stages, each containing a heat exchanger and a condensate collector. The sequence has a cold end and a hot end while intermediate stages have intermediate temperatures. The stages have different pressures corresponding to the boiling points of water at the stage temperatures. After the hot end there is a container called the brine heater. When the plant is operating in steady state, feed water at the cold inlet temperature flows, or is pumped, through the heat exchangers in the stages and warms up. When it reaches the brine heater it already has nearly the maximum temperature. In the heater, an amount of additional heat is added. After the heater, the water flows through valves back into the stages that have ever lower pressure and temperature. As it flows back through the stages the water is now called brine, to distinguish it from the inlet water.",

            "The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has used several processes to separate salt from sea water in desalination plants in Australia. One of these processes is reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis is a water purification process that uses a partially permeable membrane to separate ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles from drinking water. Another process is electrodialysis. Electrodialysis is used to transport salt ions from one solution through ion-exchange membranes to another solution under the influence of an applied electric potential difference. Australia also uses the process of multi-stage flash distillation to separate salt from sea water. Multi-stage flash distillation is a water desalination process that distills sea water by flashing a portion of the water into steam in multiple stages of what are essentially countercurrent heat exchangers. Multi-stage flash distillation plants produce about 26% of all desalinated water in the world but almost all new desalination plants currently use reverse osmosis due to much lower energy consumption. Another desalination process, vapor-compression desalination, refers to a distillation process where the evaporation of sea or saline water is obtained by the application of heat delivered by compressed vapor. As the system is electrically driven, this process is considered a clean process. This process is also highly reliable and simple to operate and maintain. Another process used to separate salt from sea water is the solar humidification\u2013dehumidification method. This is a thermal water desalination method that is based on evaporation of sea water or brackish water and subsequent condensation of the generated humid air, mostly at ambient pressure. This process mimics the natural water cycle but over a much shorter time frame."

The Vikings said the design includes a soccer field measuring 115 by 74 yards to accommodate a potential Major League Soccer expansion team. In 2012, the Vikings received a five-year window to host a Major League Soccer team in the state's legislation to finance the stadium, and the Vikings ownership launched a bid to own an expansion franchise. In December 2014, Vikings Vice President Lester Bagley presented rendering of the stadium configured for a potential Major League Soccer team, with tarps and curtains covering the upper deck to bring the capacity down to 20,000.",

In the TV series, Dr. David Banner, a widowed physician and scientist, who is presumed dead, travels across America under assumed names, and finds himself in positions where he helps others in need despite his terrible secret: in times of extreme anger or stress, he transforms into a huge, incredibly strong green creature, who has been named \"The Hulk\". In his travels, Banner earns money by working temporary jobs while searching for a way to either control or cure his condition. All the while, he is obsessively pursued by a tabloid newspaper reporter, Jack McGee, who is convinced that the Hulk is a deadly menace whose exposure would enhance his career.

The series ran for 13 episodes on NBC in 1982, part of a combined hour with \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" (as The Incredible Hulk and the Amazing Spider-Man). Compared to the live-action \"The Incredible Hulk\" television series from Universal, this series followed the Hulk comic books much more closely, particularly with regard to the Hulk's origin, the supporting cast (though Rio and his daughter Rita do not appear in the comics), and the heavy use of fantastical elements. This was the second Hulk animated series: in 1966, the Hulk appeared in 13 seven-minute segments as part of TV's \"The Marvel Super Heroes\". The series focuses on Dr. Bruce Banner attempting to cure himself of his transformations into the Hulk, and the Hulk defeating various monsters and villains whilst fending off the army's attempts to subdue and capture him.

Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip. In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously on 13 July 1930, and were won by France and the USA, who defeated Mexico 4\u20131 and Belgium 3\u20130 respectively.

In the final, Uruguay defeated Argentina 4\u20132 in front of 93,000 people in Montevideo, and became the first nation to win the World Cup. After the creation of the World Cup, FIFA and the IOC disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the 1932 Summer Olympics.

Propadiene (or \"allene\") and propyne (or \"methylacetylene\") are examples of isomers containing different bond types. Propadiene contains two double bonds, whereas propyne contains one triple bond. In stereoisomers the bond structure is the same, but the geometrical positioning of atoms and functional groups in space differs. This class includes enantiomers which are non-superposable mirror-images of each other, and diastereomers, which are not. Enantiomers always contain chiral centers and diastereomers often do, but there are some diastereomers that neither are chiral nor contain chiral centers. Another type of isomer, conformational isomers (conformers), may be rotamers, diastereomers, or enantiomers depending on the exact compound. For example, ortho- position-locked biphenyl systems have enantiomers. E/Z isomers, which have restricted rotation at a double bond, are configurational isomers. They are classified as diastereomers, whether or not they contain any chiral centers. | wikipage: Enantiomer text: Enantiomer\n\nIn chemistry, an enantiomer ( ; ), also known as an optical isomer (and archaically termed antipode or optical antipode), is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis (the hands cannot be made to appear identical simply by reorientation). A single chiral atom or similar structural feature in a compound causes that compound to have two possible structures which are non-superposable, each a mirror image of the other. Each member of the pair is termed an enantiomorph (\"enantio\" = opposite ; \"morph\" = form); the structural property is termed enantiomerism. The presence of multiple chiral features in a given compound increases the number of geometric forms possible, though there may be some perfect-mirror-image pairs. Enantiopure compounds refer to samples having, within the limits of detection, molecules of only one chirality. | wikipage: Diastereomer text: Diastereomer\n\nDiastereomers (sometimes called diastereoisomers) are a type of a stereoisomer. Diastereomerism occurs when two or more stereoisomers of a compound have different configurations at one or more (but not all) of the equivalent (related) stereocenters and are not mirror images of each other. When two diastereoisomers differ from each other at only one stereocenter they are epimers. Each stereocenter gives rise to two different configurations and thus increases the number of stereoisomers by a factor of two. Diastereomers differ from enantiomers in that the latter are pairs of stereoisomers that differ in all stereocenters and are therefore mirror images of one another. Enantiomers of a compound with more than one stereocenter are also diastereomers of the other stereoisomers of that compound that are not their mirror image. Diastereomers have different physical properties (unlike enantiomers) and different chemical reactivity. Diastereoselectivity is the preference for the formation of one or more than one diastereomer over the other in an organic reaction. When the single bond between the two centres is free to rotate, cis/trans descriptors become invalid.",

However, both Greene's character and personality are actually based on Bugsy Siegel: his affiliation with the mob in Los Angeles, his involvement in the development of Las Vegas, and his flamboyant tendencies. Greene is portrayed in the movie by Alex Rocco. Greene is introduced in \"The Godfather\" as a renowned Jewish mobster and former executioner for Murder, Inc. He is credited with the development of gambling and entertainment in Las Vegas and bringing the interests of the most powerful organized crime organizations in America to Nevada. Greene is in business with Don Vito Corleone, who bankrolls the creation of Greene's first hotel-casino. In return, Greene takes the Don's son Fredo under his wing during the war between the Five Families in New York, due to the intervention of West Coast Don Francesco.

The character's name is a composite of real Las Vegas mobsters Moe Dalitz, or possibly Moe Sedway, and Gus Greenbaum. However, both Greene's character and personality are actually based on Bugsy Siegel: his affiliation with the mob in Los Angeles, his involvement in the development of Las Vegas, and his flamboyant tendencies. Greene is portrayed in the movie by Alex Rocco. Greene is introduced in \"The Godfather\" as a renowned Jewish mobster and former executioner for Murder, Inc. He is credited with the development of gambling and entertainment in Las Vegas and bringing the interests of the most powerful organized crime organizations in America to Nevada. Greene is in business with Don Vito Corleone, who bankrolls the creation of Greene's first hotel-casino. In return, Greene takes the Don's son Fredo under his wing during the war between the Five Families in New York, due to the intervention of West Coast Don Francesco. Although Fredo is greatly influenced by both Greene and the city, family heir Michael Corleone disapproves of the effect it has on his brother, whom Greene reportedly chastised and slapped around in public.",

The song was originally titled \"Farewell Song\" in a songbook by Burnett dated to around 1913. An early version was recorded by Emry Arthur in 1928, which gave the song its current titles. There exist a number of versions of the song that differ in their lyrics and melodies. The song was popularized by The Stanley Brothers who recorded the song in the 1950s, and many versions were recorded in the 1960s, most notably by Bob Dylan. Variations of the song have also been recorded under the titles of \"Girl of Constant Sorrow\" by Joan Baez, \"Maid of Constant Sorrow\" by Judy Collins, and \"Sorrow\" by Peter, Paul and Mary. In 1970 the song was recorded by Ginger Baker's Air Force, with vocals by Denny Laine, and reached No. 85 on the Billboard Chart. Public interest in the song was renewed after the release of the 2000 film \"O Brother, Where Art Thou? \", where it plays a central role in the plot. The song, with lead vocal by Dan Tyminski, was also included in the film's highly successful, multiple-platinum-selling soundtrack. | wikipage: Man of Constant Sorrow text: Garst nevertheless noted that parts of the lyrics suggest a possible antecedent hymn, and that the term \"man of sorrows\" is religious in nature and appears in Isaiah 53:3. Emry Arthur, a friend of Burnett and who released a recording of the song in 1928, also claimed to have written the song. Arthur titled his recording \"I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow\", which became the name the song is now popularly known. The lyrics of Burnett and Arthur are very similar with minor variations, and as Arthur's song was the earliest recording of the song that was released, the tune and lyrics of Arthur's version became the source from which most later versions were ultimately derived. A number of similar songs were found in Kentucky and Virginia in the early 20th century. English folk song collector Cecil Sharp collected four versions of the song in 1917-1918 as \"In Old Virginny\", which were published in 1932 in \"English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians\". The lyrics were different in details from Burnett's but similar in tone. In a version from 1918 by Mrs Frances Richards, who probably learnt it from her father, the first verse is nearly identical to Burnett/Arthur's version, with minor changes and Virginia substituting for Kentucky. The song is thought to be related to several songs such as \"East Virginia Blues\". | wikipage: Man of Constant Sorrow text: This recording won a Grammy for Best Country Collaboration at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards in 2002. The song was first published in 1913 as \"Farewell Song\" in a six-song songbook by Dick Burnett, titled \"Songs Sung by R. D. Burnett\u2014The Blind Man\u2014Monticello, Kentucky\". Some uncertainty however exists as to whether Dick Burnett himself wrote the song. In an interview he gave toward the end of his life, Burnett himself indicated he could not remember:\n\nThe date of its composition, or at least of the editing of certain lyrics by Burnett, can be fixed at about 1913 if Burnett did write the song. It is known that Burnett was blinded in 1907, and since the second stanza of \"Farewell Song\" mentions that the singer has been blind six years, that would put the date at 1913. Burnett may have tailored a pre-existing song to fit his blindness, and some claimed that Burnett wrote the song in 1907, deriving it from \"The White Rose\" and \"Down in the Tennessee Valley\". Burnett also said he thought he based the melody on an old Baptist hymn he remembered as \"Wandering Boy\".

The Mariners finished with a record, tying the major league record for wins set by the Chicago Cubs in 1906, and setting the record for wins by an American League team. Of those wins, 59 were by four or more runs, a record for the number of games won by such a margin. They also led the majors in both runs scored and fewest runs allowed. Winning the American League West division, the 2001 season marked the only time the Mariners reached the postseason in consecutive seasons to date, following their wild card berth in 2000. The team went on to defeat the Cleveland Indians in the American League Division Series, but fell to the New York Yankees in five games in the American League Championship Series. The 2001 season was also notable for the Major League debut of star Japanese outfielder Ichiro Suzuki, who led the league in batting average and won both the AL Rookie of the Year and the AL MVP, as well as the Mariners hosting their second All-Star Game. To date, it is also the last season where the Mariners reached the postseason. On December 31, 2017, when the NFL\u2019s Buffalo Bills made the 2017 NFL Playoffs, qualifying for the first time since 1999, the Seattle Mariners now own the longest playoff drought in all of North American professional sports.",

It was the third McDonald's restaurant and opened on August 18, 1953. It was also the second restaurant franchised by Richard and Maurice McDonald, prior to the involvement of Ray Kroc in the company. The restaurant is now the oldest in the chain still in existence and is one of Downey's main tourist attractions. Along with its sign, it was deemed eligible for addition to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, although it was not added because the owner objected. The McDonald brothers opened their first restaurant adjacent to the Monrovia Airport in 1937. It was a tiny octagonal building informally called The Airdrome. That octagonal building was later moved to 1398 North E Street in San Bernardino, California, in 1940. It was originally a barbecue drive-in, but the brothers discovered that most of their profits came from hamburgers. In 1948, they closed their restaurant for three months, reopening it in December as a walk-up hamburger stand that sold hamburgers, potato chips, and orange juice; the following year, french fries and Coca-Cola were added to the menu. | wikipage: Richard and Maurice McDonald text: Later, the brothers started franchising the entire concept, with restaurants built to a standard design, created by Fontana, California, architect Stanley Clark Meston, and featuring Richard's suggestion of the paired Golden Arches, which formed an \"M\" when viewed from an angle. In 1954, the McDonald brothers partnered with Ray Kroc. The franchiser took 1.9 percent of the gross sales, of which the McDonald brothers got 0.5 percent. The brothers wished to maintain only a small number of restaurants, which conflicted with Kroc's goals. Ray Kroc eventually bought them out. On November 30, 1984, Richard McDonald, the first cook behind the grill of a McDonald's, was served the ceremonial 50 billionth McDonald's hamburger by Ed Rensi, then president of McDonald's USA, at the Grand Hyatt hotel in New York City. Maurice McDonald died from heart failure in Riverside, California, on December 11, 1971, at the age of 69. He was buried at the Desert Memorial Park, in Cathedral City, California. Richard McDonald died in Bedford, New Hampshire, on July 14, 1998, at the age of 89 and was buried nearby at the Mount Calvary Cemetery in his home city of Manchester.

In 1937, the McDonald brothers opened a hot dog stand in Monrovia, California, inspired by a local hot dog stand that seemed to be the only profitable business in town, and which primarily served patrons at a local racetrack. However, the stand had few customers after racing season ended. Maurice decided to open a bigger hot dog stand in San Bernardino, a large working-class town approximately 50 miles eastward, with a population of approximately 100,000 people. After several banks declined to lend them the money needed for this venture, Bank of America finally approved, and in 1940, with $5,000 in capital, they opened a drive-in restaurant on the corner of 1398 North E Street and West 14th Street (). The new restaurant proved a surprise success and the brothers were soon making $40,000 a year. Most customers were teenage or young adult males in their 20s who came there primarily to flirt with the carhop young women, or young working families looking for a cheap meal.

The restaurant is now the oldest in the chain still in existence and is one of Downey's main tourist attractions. Along with its sign, it was deemed eligible for addition to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, although it was not added because the owner objected. The McDonald brothers opened their first restaurant adjacent to the Monrovia Airport in 1937. It was a tiny octagonal building informally called The Airdrome. That octagonal building was later moved to 1398 North E Street in San Bernardino, California, in 1940. It was originally a barbecue drive-in, but the brothers discovered that most of their profits came from hamburgers. In 1948, they closed their restaurant for three months, reopening it in December as a walk-up hamburger stand that sold hamburgers, potato chips, and orange juice; the following year, french fries and Coca-Cola were added to the menu.",

In 1954, the McDonald brothers partnered with Ray Kroc. The franchiser took 1.9 percent of the gross sales, of which the McDonald brothers got 0.5 percent. The brothers wished to maintain only a small number of restaurants, which conflicted with Kroc's goals. Ray Kroc eventually bought them out. On November 30, 1984, Richard McDonald, the first cook behind the grill of a McDonald's, was served the ceremonial 50 billionth McDonald's hamburger by Ed Rensi, then president of McDonald's USA, at the Grand Hyatt hotel in New York City. Maurice McDonald died from heart failure in Riverside, California, on December 11, 1971, at the age of 69. He was buried at the Desert Memorial Park, in Cathedral City, California.

However, the stand had few customers after racing season ended. Maurice decided to open a bigger hot dog stand in San Bernardino, a large working-class town approximately 50 miles eastward, with a population of approximately 100,000 people. After several banks declined to lend them the money needed for this venture, Bank of America finally approved, and in 1940, with $5,000 in capital, they opened a drive-in restaurant on the corner of 1398 North E Street and West 14th Street (). The new restaurant proved a surprise success and the brothers were soon making $40,000 a year. Most customers were teenage or young adult males in their 20s who came there primarily to flirt with the carhop young women, or young working families looking for a cheap meal. The McDonald brothers decided that the latter were the ideal customer they wanted to attract.",

The Great Red Spot (GRS) is a persistent anticyclonic storm, 22\u00b0 south of Jupiter's equator; observations from Earth establish a minimum storm lifetime of 350 years.

The amendment also passed the House, and on December 26, 1941, President Roosevelt signed this bill, for the first time making the date of Thanksgiving a matter of federal law and fixing the day as the fourth Thursday of November. For several years some states continued to observe the last-Thursday date in years with five November Thursdays (the next such year being 1944), with Texas doing so as late as 1956. The poor are often provided with food at Thanksgiving time. Most communities have annual food drives that collect non-perishable packaged and canned foods, and corporations sponsor charitable distributions of staple foods and Thanksgiving dinners. The Salvation Army enlists volunteers to serve Thanksgiving dinners to hundreds of people in different locales. Additionally, pegged to be five days after Thanksgiving is Giving Tuesday, a celebration of charitable giving. U.S. tradition compares the holiday with a meal held in 1621 by the Wampanoag and the Pilgrims who settled at Plymouth Plantation.

England and other Germanic-speaking countries of northern Europe formerly used various standardised \"stones\" for trade, with their values ranging from about 5 to 40 local pounds (roughly 3 to 15\u00a0kg) depending on the location and objects weighed. The United Kingdom's imperial system adopted the wool stone of 14 pounds in 1835. With the advent of metrication, Europe's various \"stones\" were superseded by or adapted to the kilogram from the mid-19th century on.

The Biblical law against the carrying of \"diverse weights, a large and a small\" is more literally translated as \"you shall not carry a stone and a stone (), a large and a small\".

Kenya has had two major constitutional reforms involving wholly new texts since gaining independence: in 1969 and in 2010. In 1969, the 1963 independence constitution was replaced with a new text that entrenched amendments already made to the system of government that the independence constitution had contemplated. These changes included: changing the structure of the state from a federal, or Majimbo system, to a unitary system; creating a unicameral instead of bicameral legislature; changing from a parliamentary to a semi-presidential system with a powerful presidency; and reducing the protections of the bill of rights. Further amendments to the 1969 constitution were later effected, including, in 1982, the institution of a de jure single party government.",

France did consider the landing of 40,000 men in the nearby British Isles but abandoned the idea because of logistical issues. On the continent, France was protected through its alliance with Austria which, even if it did not take part in the American Revolutionary War, affirmed its diplomatic support of France. Other nations in Europe at first refused to openly join the war but both Spain and the Dutch Republic gave unofficial support to the American cause. Vergennes was able to convince the Spanish to formally enter the war in 1779 and, in 1780, Britain declared war on the Dutch Republic over claims of Dutch violations of neutrality. French participation in North America was initially maritime in nature and marked by some indecision on the part of its military leaders. In 1778, American and French planners organized an attempt to capture Newport, Rhode Island, then under British occupation. The attempt failed, in part because Admiral d'Estaing did not land French troops prior to sailing out of Narragansett Bay to meet the British fleet.

The British, after threatening to burn the city if their departure was hindered, evacuated the city on March 17, 1776 and sailed for temporary refuge in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The local militias dispersed and, in April, General Washington took most of the Continental Army to fortify New York City and the start of the New York and New Jersey campaign.

            "British rock band Asking Alexandria has changed its lead singer several times. The band's original lead singer was replaced by Danny Worsnop, an English musician, singer, songwriter, vocal producer, and actor. In May 2015, the band's new lead singer was revealed to be Ukrainian musician Denis Stoff, who was its lead vocalist during Worsnop's 18-month hiatus from the band. Worsnop returned to be the band's lead singer after Stoff left."

Speculation regarding Stoff's involvement started shortly after Worsnop's departure due to similarities between Asking Alexandria and Make Me Famous (who were said to have been ripping off the band); the fact that they were label mates would have made the transition easy for Stoff to make, and on his personal YouTube account he had covered multiple Asking Alexandria songs. Ben Bruce was asked if he considered anyone else for the role and he stated that \"it has to be Denis\" before praising his vocal ability. When Shaforostov himself was asked how he would distinguish himself from Worsnop, he stated he would not make any comparison since he is a completely different person. In October 2016, Ben Bruce announced that Stoff left the band. In December 2017, Rock Sound interviewed Denis. Denis explained that his home country, Ukraine, is like a warzone now. He said there was stress for him and his family, and he had to stop touring to focus on family.

The next Protestant in line to the throne was the Electress Sophia of Hanover, a granddaughter of James VI of Scotland and I of England. After her the crowns would descend only to her non-Roman Catholic heirs. The act was prompted by the failure of King William III and Queen Mary II, as well as of Mary's sister Queen Anne, to produce any surviving children, and the Roman Catholic religion of all other members of the House of Stuart. The line of Sophia of Hanover was the most junior among the Stuarts, but consisted of convinced Protestants. Sophia died on 8 June 1714, before the death of Queen Anne on 1 August 1714. On Queen Anne's death, Sophia's son duly became King George I and started the Hanoverian dynasty in Britain. The act played a key role in the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain. England and Scotland had shared a monarch since 1603, but had remained separately governed countries.

The U.S. 1st Division, the most experienced of the five American divisions then in France and in reserve for the French Army near the village of Cantigny, was selected for the attack. The objective of the attack was both to reduce a small salient made by the German Army in the front lines but also to instill confidence among the French and British allies in the ability of the inexperienced American Expeditionary Force (AEF). At 06:45 [H Hour], 28 May 1918, American soldiers of the 28th Infantry Regiment left their jump-off trenches following an hour-long artillery preparation. Part of the preparation was counter-battery fire directed at German artillery positions. A rolling barrage, advancing 100 meters every two minutes, was calculated to give the attacking troops time to keep up with it. The 28th Infantry Regiment (Colonel Hansen Ely, commanding) plus two companies of the 18th Infantry, three machine-gun companies and a company of engineers (3,564 men), captured Cantigny from units of the German Eighteenth Army. The village was situated on high ground surrounded by woods, making it an ideal observation post for German artillery.",

The stimulus package was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on January 29, 2008, and in a slightly different version by the U.S. Senate on February 7, 2008. The Senate version was then approved in the House the same day. It was signed into law on February 13, 2008 by President Bush with the support of both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. The law provides for tax rebates to low- and middle-income U.S. taxpayers, tax incentives to stimulate business investment, and an increase in the limits imposed on mortgages eligible for purchase by government-sponsored enterprises (e.g., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). The total cost of this bill was projected at $152 billion for 2008. Tax rebates created by the law were paid to individual U.S. taxpayers during 2008. Most taxpayers below the income limit received a rebate of at least $300 per person ($600 for married couples filing jointly). Eligible taxpayers received, along with their individual payment, $300 per dependent child under the age of 17. | wikipage: Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 text: As 2008 began, economic indicators suggested an increased risk of recession. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testified before Congress that quick action was needed to stimulate the economy through targeted government spending and tax incentives. Congress moved rapidly to pass such legislation. The legislation was designed to stimulate spending by businesses and consumers during 2008. The hope was that the targeted individual tax rebates would boost consumer spending and that targeted tax incentives would boost business spending. Lawmakers raised the limits on conforming mortgages eligible for government insurance and GSE purchase in response to the subprime mortgage crisis. This crisis had resulted in a widespread credit crunch by late 2007. The credit crunch led to a reluctance by lenders to issue so-called jumbo mortgages for the purchase of houses that exceeded the FHA and GSE limits. The United States housing bubble had pushed house prices above those limits in many areas of the country. As interest rates rose for jumbo mortgages, fewer buyers could afford them, and house prices were being forced down toward the limits for conforming mortgages. By raising those limits, lawmakers hoped to slow or halt the decline in house prices, which threatened the financial well-being of homeowners, banks and other financial entities holding jumbo mortgages. The FHA loan limits also went up with the stimulus package on March 6.",

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testified before Congress that quick action was needed to stimulate the economy through targeted government spending and tax incentives. Congress moved rapidly to pass such legislation. The legislation was designed to stimulate spending by businesses and consumers during 2008. The hope was that the targeted individual tax rebates would boost consumer spending and that targeted tax incentives would boost business spending. Lawmakers raised the limits on conforming mortgages eligible for government insurance and GSE purchase in response to the subprime mortgage crisis. This crisis had resulted in a widespread credit crunch by late 2007. The credit crunch led to a reluctance by lenders to issue so-called jumbo mortgages for the purchase of houses that exceeded the FHA and GSE limits. The United States housing bubble had pushed house prices above those limits in many areas of the country. As interest rates rose for jumbo mortgages, fewer buyers could afford them, and house prices were being forced down toward the limits for conforming mortgages. By raising those limits, lawmakers hoped to slow or halt the decline in house prices, which threatened the financial well-being of homeowners, banks and other financial entities holding jumbo mortgages. The FHA loan limits also went up with the stimulus package on March 6.",

Backward failure can be subdivided into the failure of the left atrium, the left ventricle or both within the left circuit. The patient will have dyspnea (shortness of breath) on exertion and in severe cases, dyspnea at rest. Increasing breathlessness on lying flat, called orthopnea, occurs. It is often measured in the number of pillows required to lie comfortably, and in orthopnea, the patient may resort to sleeping while sitting up. Another symptom of heart failure is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea: a sudden nighttime attack of severe breathlessness, usually several hours after going to sleep. Easy fatigability and exercise intolerance are also common complaints related to respiratory compromise. \"Cardiac asthma\" or wheezing may occur. Compromise of left ventricular \"forward\" function may result in symptoms of poor systemic circulation such as dizziness, confusion and cool extremities at rest. Right-sided heart failure is often caused by pulmonary heart disease (cor pulmonale), which is typically caused by difficulties of the pulmonary circulation, such as pulmonary hypertension or pulmonic stenosis. | wikipage: Heart failure text: The left side of the heart is responsible for receiving oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumping it forward to the systemic circulation (the rest of the body except for the pulmonary circulation). Failure of the left side of the heart causes blood to back up (be congested) into the lungs, causing respiratory symptoms as well as fatigue due to insufficient supply of oxygenated blood. Common respiratory signs are increased rate of breathing and increased \"work\" of breathing (non-specific signs of respiratory distress). Rales or crackles, heard initially in the lung bases, and when severe, throughout the lung fields suggest the development of pulmonary edema (fluid in the alveoli). Cyanosis which suggests severe low blood oxygen, is a late sign of extremely severe pulmonary edema. Additional signs indicating left ventricular failure include a laterally displaced apex beat (which occurs if the heart is enlarged) and a gallop rhythm (additional heart sounds) may be heard as a marker of increased blood flow or increased intra-cardiac pressure. Heart murmurs may indicate the presence of valvular heart disease, either as a cause (e.g. aortic stenosis) or as a result (e.g. mitral regurgitation) of the heart failure.",

Backward failure can be subdivided into the failure of the left atrium, the left ventricle or both within the left circuit. The patient will have dyspnea (shortness of breath) on exertion and in severe cases, dyspnea at rest. Increasing breathlessness on lying flat, called orthopnea, occurs. It is often measured in the number of pillows required to lie comfortably, and in orthopnea, the patient may resort to sleeping while sitting up. Another symptom of heart failure is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea: a sudden nighttime attack of severe breathlessness, usually several hours after going to sleep. Easy fatigability and exercise intolerance are also common complaints related to respiratory compromise. \"Cardiac asthma\" or wheezing may occur.

Designed by Danish architect J\u00f8rn Utzon, the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation. The building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and close by the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Though its name suggests a single venue, the building comprises multiple performance venues which together host well over 1,500 performances annually, attended by more than 1.2\u00a0million people. Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, including three resident companies: Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.",

It marked the return of professional football to the city of Cleveland, Ohio for the first time since the 1995 season, when the franchise was temporarily deactivated following the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, which ultimately established the Baltimore Ravens. Officially, the Browns are considered a continuation of the previous franchise, as the history and colors of the team remained in Cleveland. The franchise was still alive as a legal entity between 1996\u20131998 and its assets kept in a trust managed by the NFL until Al Lerner became the owner in 1998. The Browns, however, in 1999 were treated as a new franchise by having an expansion draft and receiving the number one overall draft pick. During the course of the 1995 season, then-Browns owner Art Modell announced his decision to move the Browns to Baltimore. Modell's new team would begin playing in the 1996 season. It would be the first time since 1935 that Cleveland would be left without an existing football team and the first time since 1943 without a team playing, when the Cleveland Rams suspended operation for one year, so the other teams could have enough players during World War II.

The Browns reached their third AFC Championship Game in four seasons, and for the third time lost to the Denver Broncos. It would be the Browns's fifth consecutive season making the playoffs, but it would be their last playoff season until 1994. Bud Carson begins his Browns head coaching career with a memorable 51-0 victory over the Steelers in Pittsburgh. It is the most lopsided victory in the 79-game series between the teams and the Browns' biggest shutout ever. Carson, Pittsburgh's former defensive coordinator, watches his team force eight turnovers, record seven sacks and score three touchdowns (two by linebacker David Grayson). The Browns snap a 10-game losing streak to Denver with a controversial 16-13 win at Cleveland. The game was decided by a Matt Bahr 48-yard field goal as time expired - a kick that barely made the crossbar. Bahr's field goal comes after referee Tom Dooley ordered the teams to switch ends of the field, thanks to rowdy Dawg Pound fans who pelt the Broncos with dog biscuits, eggs and other debris.

It is influenced by the Calypso style of the Caribbean which originated in Trinidad and Tobago, as well as Reggae, which originated in Jamaica. The song was performed in the film by Samuel E. Wright. The track won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1989, as well as the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media in 1991. The song is a plea by the crab Sebastian imploring Ariel to remain sea-bound, and resist her desire to become a human in order to spend her life with Prince Eric, with whom she has fallen in love. Sebastian warns of the struggles of human life while at the same time expounding the benefits of a care-free life underwater. However, his plea falls on deaf ears, for Ariel leaves before the end of the song. In 2002, the song was featured in the Square Enix action RPG \"Kingdom Hearts\" as the background music for the Atlantica world. | wikipage: Under the Sea text: In 2006, the song also appeared in \"Kingdom Hearts II\" as part of a minigame where it was rearranged to have parts for Sebastian, Ariel, and Sora.

It is influenced by the Calypso style of the Caribbean which originated in Trinidad and Tobago, as well as Reggae, which originated in Jamaica. The song was performed in the film by Samuel E. Wright. The track won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1989, as well as the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media in 1991. The song is a plea by the crab Sebastian imploring Ariel to remain sea-bound, and resist her desire to become a human in order to spend her life with Prince Eric, with whom she has fallen in love. Sebastian warns of the struggles of human life while at the same time expounding the benefits of a care-free life underwater. However, his plea falls on deaf ears, for Ariel leaves before the end of the song. In 2002, the song was featured in the Square Enix action RPG \"Kingdom Hearts\" as the background music for the Atlantica world.",

In 2009, Game Freak remade \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" for the Nintendo DS as \"Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\". The games introduce 100 new species of Pok\u00e9mon, and follow the progress of the central character, whose name the player may choose, in his quest to master Pok\u00e9mon battling. Both games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and, while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between them and their backward compatible predecessors in order to fully complete the games' Pok\u00e9dexes. The Johto Saga of the Pok\u00e9mon anime is based on the new region introduced in the games. \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\" were critically acclaimed upon release. They are considered to be the best games in the entire series, as well as some of the fifth generation console gaming's most significant titles.

The product functions like a normal Game Link Cable and consists of a yellow cable with a figure of Pikachu on one end, and a Pok\u00e9 Ball on the other. Anticipating high sales, Nintendo set its first production shipment for the games in Japan at three million, predicting that eventually more than eight million copies would be sold in the country alone. However, they were soon forced to cut the first shipment number in half following an earthquake in Taiwan, which Nintendo claimed had damaged their cartridge manufacturing facilities. Regardless, speculation arose that Nintendo was instead using the event as an excuse to limit shipment and keep the demand high. As a precursor to the North American release, \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" were displayed for audiences to interact with at the 2000 American International Toy Fair in New York City. To further promote the games, Nintendo modified five Chrysler PT Cruisers to resemble the new Pok\u00e9mon Lugia and had them driven around the U.S.A.

They were released in Japan in 1999, Australia and North America in 2000, and Europe in 2001. \"Pok\u00e9mon Crystal\", a special edition, was released roughly a year later in each region. In 2009, Game Freak remade \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" for the Nintendo DS as \"Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\". The games introduce 100 new species of Pok\u00e9mon, and follow the progress of the central character, whose name the player may choose, in his quest to master Pok\u00e9mon battling. Both games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and, while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between them and their backward compatible predecessors in order to fully complete the games' Pok\u00e9dexes. The Johto Saga of the Pok\u00e9mon anime is based on the new region introduced in the games. \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\" were critically acclaimed upon release. They are considered to be the best games in the entire series, as well as some of the fifth generation console gaming's most significant titles. They continued the enormous success of their predecessors as \"Pok\u00e9mon\" began to form into a multi-billion dollar franchise.",

In addition, an officially licensed Pikachu-themed Game Link Cable developed by Kemco was set for release in Japan on November 18, 1999. The product functions like a normal Game Link Cable and consists of a yellow cable with a figure of Pikachu on one end, and a Pok\u00e9 Ball on the other. Anticipating high sales, Nintendo set its first production shipment for the games in Japan at three million, predicting that eventually more than eight million copies would be sold in the country alone. However, they were soon forced to cut the first shipment number in half following an earthquake in Taiwan, which Nintendo claimed had damaged their cartridge manufacturing facilities. Regardless, speculation arose that Nintendo was instead using the event as an excuse to limit shipment and keep the demand high. As a precursor to the North American release, \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" were displayed for audiences to interact with at the 2000 American International Toy Fair in New York City. To further promote the games, Nintendo modified five Chrysler PT Cruisers to resemble the new Pok\u00e9mon Lugia and had them driven around the U.S.A.

He first appears in John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" (1978) as a young boy who murders his sister, Judith Myers, and then, fifteen years later, returns home to Haddonfield to murder more teenagers. In the original \"Halloween\", the adult Michael Myers, referred to as The Shape in the closing credits, was portrayed by Nick Castle for most of the film, with Tony Moran and Tommy Lee Wallace substituting in the final scenes. The character was created by Debra Hill and John Carpenter and has appeared in ten films, as well as novels, multiple video games, and several comic books. The character is the primary antagonist in the \"Halloween\" film series, except \"\", which is not connected in continuity to the rest of the films. Since Castle, Moran, and Wallace put on the mask in the original film, six people have stepped into the same role. Castle, George P. Wilbur, and Tyler Mane are the only actors to have portrayed Michael Myers more than once, with Mane being the only one to do so in consecutive films. Michael Myers is characterized as pure evil, both directly in the films, by the filmmakers who created and developed the character over nine films, as well as by random participants in a survey.",

Ellaria first appears in \"A Storm of Swords\" (2000), and while she is only mentioned in \"A Feast for Crows\" (2005), she returns in \"A Dance with Dragons\" (2011). Ellaria Sand is a bastard from Dorne but is not discriminated against for this, as Dorne's views and customs towards children born out of wedlock differ from those of the rest of Westeros, where bastards are often discriminated against. She is the paramour of Oberyn Martell, as even in Dorne a Prince cannot marry a bastard. She is the mother of the youngest four Sand Snakes (Oberyn's bastard daughters). Like Oberyn, she is bisexual. In the novels, Ellaria Sand is mostly a background character. She is not a point of view character; rather, her actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people.

It is split horizontally into an upper red half and a lower black half with an emblem resting at the center. It features a yellow half gear wheel crossed by a machete and crowned with a star. The Angolan flag is based on the flag of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which fought Portuguese colonial rule and emerged as the ruling party of Angola following the Angolan Civil War. The MPLA flag is similar to the flag of Angola but features a star in place of the central emblem. The National Flag of the Republic of Angola has two horizontal bands of red and black with the Machete and Gear Emblem in gold in the center consisted of a five pointed-star within a half gear wheel crossed by a machete (resembling the hammer and sickle used on the Soviet flag). As outlined in the Constitution of Angola, the red half of the flag signifies bloodshed during Angola's independence struggle, and the black half symbolizes Africa. In the central emblem, the gear represents industrial workers, the machete represents peasantry and the star is shaped like the red star, symbolized socialism. The flag is most recently described and explained in article 162 of the Constitutional Law of the Republic of Angola (Constitution) of August 25, 1992. | wikipage: Flag of Romania text: Flag of Romania\n\nThe national flag of Romania () is a tricolor with vertical stripes, beginning from the flagpole: blue, yellow and red. It has a width-length ratio of 2:3. The Constitution of Romania provides that \"The flag of Romania is tricolor; the colors are arranged vertically in the following order from the flagpole: blue, yellow, red\". The proportions, shades of color as well as the flag protocol were established by law in 1994 and extended in 2001. The flag is coincidentally very similar to the civil flag of Andorra and the state flag of Chad. The similarity with Chad's flag, which differs only in having a darker shade of blue (indigo rather than cobalt), has caused international discussion. In 2004, Chad asked the United Nations to examine the issue, but then-president of Romania Ion Iliescu announced no change would occur to the flag. The flag of Moldova is related to the Romanian tricolor, except it has a 1:2 ratio, a lighter shade of blue, a slightly different tint of yellow, and the Moldovan coat of arms in the middle. The civil ensign of Belgium uses black rather than blue. The law mentioned above specifies that the stripes of the national flag are cobalt blue, chrome yellow and vermilion red. | wikipage: Algeria national football team text: Algeria national football team\n\nThe Algeria national football team represents Algeria in association football and is controlled by the Algerian Football Federation. The team plays its home games at the Stade 5 Juillet 1962 in Algiers. Algeria joined FIFA on 1 January 1964, a year and a half after gaining independence. Algeria have qualified for four World Cups in 1982, 1986, 2010 and 2014. Algeria won the African Cup of Nations once in 1990, when they hosted the tournament. At the 2014 World Cup, Algeria became the first African team to score four goals in a match at the World Cup against South Korea. The traditional rivals of Algeria have been Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. However, more recently, Egypt has become the main rival after a number of incidents involving the two teams, most recently during the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, in which Algeria defeated Egypt 1\u20130 in a tense tiebreaker in Omdurman in Sudan to qualify to the World Cup. A few months later, Algeria was then defeated by Egypt 0\u20134 in a tense match in Angola during the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, which added to the rivalry. The team was established in 1962 after gaining independence from France, as the successor of the FLN football team. Under French rule, Algeria was not allowed to have a national team, the FLN football team was sort of a rebellion against the French colonization.",

It is split horizontally into an upper red half and a lower black half with an emblem resting at the center. It features a yellow half gear wheel crossed by a machete and crowned with a star. The Angolan flag is based on the flag of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which fought Portuguese colonial rule and emerged as the ruling party of Angola following the Angolan Civil War. The MPLA flag is similar to the flag of Angola but features a star in place of the central emblem. The National Flag of the Republic of Angola has two horizontal bands of red and black with the Machete and Gear Emblem in gold in the center consisted of a five pointed-star within a half gear wheel crossed by a machete (resembling the hammer and sickle used on the Soviet flag). As outlined in the Constitution of Angola, the red half of the flag signifies bloodshed during Angola's independence struggle, and the black half symbolizes Africa. In the central emblem, the gear represents industrial workers, the machete represents peasantry and the star is shaped like the red star, symbolized socialism. The flag is most recently described and explained in article 162 of the Constitutional Law of the Republic of Angola (Constitution) of August 25, 1992.",

It has a width-length ratio of 2:3. The Constitution of Romania provides that \"The flag of Romania is tricolor; the colors are arranged vertically in the following order from the flagpole: blue, yellow, red\". The proportions, shades of color as well as the flag protocol were established by law in 1994 and extended in 2001. The flag is coincidentally very similar to the civil flag of Andorra and the state flag of Chad. The similarity with Chad's flag, which differs only in having a darker shade of blue (indigo rather than cobalt), has caused international discussion. In 2004, Chad asked the United Nations to examine the issue, but then-president of Romania Ion Iliescu announced no change would occur to the flag. The flag of Moldova is related to the Romanian tricolor, except it has a 1:2 ratio, a lighter shade of blue, a slightly different tint of yellow, and the Moldovan coat of arms in the middle. The civil ensign of Belgium uses black rather than blue. The law mentioned above specifies that the stripes of the national flag are cobalt blue, chrome yellow and vermilion red.",

A few months later, Algeria was then defeated by Egypt 0\u20134 in a tense match in Angola during the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, which added to the rivalry. The team was established in 1962 after gaining independence from France, as the successor of the FLN football team.

Most kinds of daylilies occur as clumps, each of which has leaves, a crown, flowers, and roots. The long, linear lanceolate leaves are grouped into opposite fans with arching leaves. The crown is the small white portion between the leaves and the roots. Along the scape of some kinds of daylilies, small leafy \"proliferations\" form at nodes or in bracts. A proliferation forms roots when planted and is often an exact clone of its parent plant. Many kinds of daylilies have thickened roots in which they store food and water. A normal, single daylily flower has three petals and three sepals, collectively called tepals, each with a midrib in either the same basic color or a different color. The centermost part of the flower, called the throat, usually is of a different color than the more distal areas of the tepals.

Some horticulturists use \"variety\" imprecisely; for example, viticulturists almost always refer to grape cultivars as \"grape varieties\".",

Many kinds of daylilies form clumps of crowded shoots. It is possible to dig up every 3 or so years, separate shoots, and replant only some of the shoots to reduce crowding. This process increases the flowering of many cultivars. In the last several decades, many hybridizers have focused on breeding tetraploid plants, which tend to have sturdier scapes and tepals than diploids and some flower-color traits that are not found in diploids. Until this trend took root, nearly all daylilies were diploid. \"Tets,\" as they are called by aficionados, have 44 chromosomes, while triploids have 33 chromosomes and diploids have 22 chromosomes per individual plant. \"Hemerocallis fulva\" 'Europa', \"H. fulva\" 'Kwanso', \"H. fulva\" 'Kwanso Variegata', \"H. fulva\" 'Kwanso Kaempfer', \"H. fulva\" var. \"maculata\", \"H. fulva\" var.",

It was written by Randy Bachman after hearing Bob Dylan's \"Ballad in Plain D\", which included the phrase \"she was easily undone\". Bachman's song tells the story of a girl he had seen at a party who, after dropping acid, slipped into a coma. The song takes its structure from new jazz guitar chords Bachman had learned from his friend and neighbour Lenny Breau. During the Guess Who's 2000 reunion tour, Running Back Thru Canada, Bachman's former bandmate Burton Cummings declared the song to be one of Bachman's finest compositions and \"one of the best songs ever written by any Canadian songwriter\".

The song gained in popularity when disc jockeys started turning the \"Laughing\" record over. The song plays in the background of a fight scene between Robert De Niro and Bridget Fonda in Quentin Tarantino's 1997 film \"Jackie Brown\".

It became common to wear white pants with a white color vest at home and gray pants with a gray or solid (dark) colored vest when away. By 1900, both home and away uniforms were standard across the major leagues. Spring training is a series of practices and exhibition games preceding the start of the regular season. Spring training allows new players to audition for roster and position spots, and gives existing team players practice time prior to competitive play. The teams are divided into the Cactus League and the Grapefruit League. Spring training has always attracted fan attention, drawing crowds who travel to the warmer climates to enjoy the weather and watch their favorite teams play, and spring training usually coincides with spring break for many college students. Autograph seekers also find greater access to players during spring training. Spring training typically lasts almost two months, starting in mid February and running until just before the season opening day, traditionally the first week of April.

However, some have praised the single, calling it a magnificent start to her career. Osment herself has stated that the song is influenced by Alanis Morissette's album, \"Jagged Little Pill\". \"All the Way Up\" failed to garner much attention on the music charts, but it did manage to enter the charts in a few international territories, as well as becoming a hit on Radio Disney. | wikipage: All the Way Up (Fat Joe and Remy Ma song) text: All the Way Up (Fat Joe and Remy Ma song)\n\n\"All the Way Up\" is a song by American rappers Fat Joe and Remy Ma, featuring American rappers French Montana and Infared.

It was released on August 25, 2009 as the lead single from the album. The song was co-written by Emily Osment and Anthony Fagenson, and was produced by James Maxwell Collins. Lyrically, Osment stated she wanted the song to be about \"breaking out\" and that \"a lot of kids can relate to that\". The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Some have praised Osment's \"spunk\", and also make comment about how she chose not to join with Hollywood Records, like most other Disney Channel artist. However, some call the song childish, stating that Osment tries to come across as \"fierce\", but just falls flat in the end. However, some have praised the single, calling it a magnificent start to her career. Osment herself has stated that the song is influenced by Alanis Morissette's album, \"Jagged Little Pill\". \"All the Way Up\" failed to garner much attention on the music charts, but it did manage to enter the charts in a few international territories, as well as becoming a hit on Radio Disney.",

After various setbacks in her career she achieved fame when she became the first athlete in her country to win an Olympic gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, and to date remains Nigeria's only individual Olympic gold medalist. Chioma Ajunwa is the first black African woman to win an Olympic gold medal in a field event. Ajunwa is also an officer with the Nigerian Police Force. Born into what she describes as \"a very poor home\", Ahiazu-Mbaise-native Ajunwa was the last of nine children, with six brothers and two sisters. Her father died while she was still young, leaving his wife to solely support a large family. At eighteen Ajunwa, who had been a keen athletics participant during her school years, gained admission into university but was unable to register due to her mother's inability to pay the fees. She later decided to become a motor mechanic, but abandoned the idea following her mother's disapproval.",

It is the third track on their 1983 album \"War\" and was released as the album's lead single in January 1983. With lyrics written about the Polish Solidarity movement, \"New Year's Day\" is driven by Adam Clayton's distinctive bassline and the Edge's piano and guitar playing. It was the band's first UK hit single, peaking at number 10, and was also their first international hit, reaching for number 9 in Norway, number 11 on the Dutch Top 40, number 17 in Sweden, and number 53 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the United States. In 2010, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine placed the single at number 435 on their list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". This song was also included in the Pitchfork 500. The UK cover features a photograph of Peter Rowen, who grew up near U2 lead vocalist Bono in Ireland. The lyric had its origins in a love song from Bono to his wife, but was subsequently reshaped and inspired by the Polish Solidarity movement. The bassline stemmed from bassist Adam Clayton trying to figure out the chords to the Visage song \"Fade to Grey\" during a soundcheck.",

Swift co-wrote and co-produced the track with Jack Antonoff. \"New Year's Day\" was written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff. Antonoff described that the song \"happened so quickly at my apartment. We texted the next morning to make sure it wasn't a dream.\" The inspiration behind came from a New Year's Eve party at Swift's London residence. About the lyrics, Swift said that \"I was thinking about how everybody talks and thinks about who you kiss at midnight [...] But I think there's something even more romantic about who's gonna deal with you on New Year's Day. Who's willing to give you Advil and clean up the house? I think that states more of a permanence.\" \"New Year's Day\" was one of the last tracks unveiled before \"Reputation\" was released, which debuted at a commercial break for the November 9 episode of ABC's \"Scandal\".",

Elias Howe Jr. was born on July 9, 1819 to Dr. Elias Howe Sr. and Polly (Bemis) Howe in Spencer, Massachusetts. Howe spent his childhood and early adult years in Massachusetts where he apprenticed in a textile factory in Lowell beginning in 1835. After mill closings due to the Panic of 1837, he moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to work as a mechanic with carding machinery, apprenticing along with his cousin Nathaniel P. Banks. Beginning in 1838, he apprenticed in the shop of Ari Davis, a master mechanic in Cambridge who specialized in the manufacture and repair of chronometers and other precision instruments. It was in the employ of Davis that Howe seized upon the idea of the sewing machine. He married Elizabeth Jennings Ames, daughter of Simon Ames and Jane B. Ames, on March 3, 1841 in Cambridge.

He is believed to have been killed there on August 24. He was only 50 years old.

A press release on the governor\u2019s website explained the decision by referencing that in the United States, 95 percent of adults smokers begin smoking before the age of 21. Almost half of those become regular smokers before the age of 18 and another 25% become regular smokers between the ages of 18-21. California became the second state to implement a statewide Tobacco 21 law. Governor Jerry Brown signed a group of bills on May 4, 2016. The pack of bills were described as the \u201cmost expansive\u201d attempt to regulate tobacco use within the state of California in over a decade. The bills were supported by various organizations and medical groups including the American Heart Association, American Cancer Society, American Lung Association, and California Medical Association. The bill was approved in a special health care session and became effective on June 9, 2016. In November 2013, New York City enacted legislation that raised the age to purchase tobacco products to 21, and also set a minimum price of $10.50 per pack of cigarettes, among other provisions. The law went into effect on May 18, 2014. The bill came with significant penalties for those who do not comply with the law.

This shift in marketing towards adolescents and even children in the tobacco industry is debilitating to organizations' and countries' efforts to improve child health and mortality in the developing world. It reverses or halts the effects of the work that has been done to improve health care in these countries, and although smoking is deemed as a \"voluntary\" health risk, the marketing of tobacco towards very impressionable adolescents in the developing world makes it less of a voluntary action and more of an inevitable shift. Many government regulations have been passed to protect citizens from harm caused by public environmental tobacco smoke. The \"Pro-Children Act of 2001\" prohibits smoking within any facility that provides health care, day care, library services, or elementary and secondary education to children in the US.

After General George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River north of Trenton the previous night, Washington led the main body of the Continental Army against Hessian mercenaries garrisoned at Trenton. After a brief battle, almost two-thirds of the Hessian force was captured, with negligible losses to the Americans. The battle significantly boosted the Continental Army's flagging morale, and inspired re-enlistments.

Eight teams have appeared in Super Bowl games without a win. The Minnesota Vikings were the first team to have appeared a record four times without a win. The Buffalo Bills played in a record four Super Bowls in a row and lost every one. Four teams (the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans) have never appeared in a Super Bowl. The Browns and Lions both won NFL Championships prior to the creation of the Super Bowl, while the Jaguars (1995) and Texans (2002) are both recent NFL expansion teams. (Detroit, Houston, and Jacksonville, however, have hosted a Super Bowl, leaving the Browns the only team to date who has neither played in nor whose city has hosted the game.) The Minnesota Vikings won the last NFL Championship before the merger but lost to the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl IV. The Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls (Known as the AFL-NFL World Championship Game for these first two contests), defeating the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders following the and seasons, respectively. The Packers were led by quarterback, Bart Starr, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for both games. | wikipage: Super Bowl IV text: Super Bowl IV\n\nSuper Bowl IV, the fourth and final AFL-NFL World Championship Game in professional American football, was played on January 11, 1970, at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, Louisiana. The American Football League (AFL) champion Kansas City Chiefs defeated the National Football League (NFL) champion Minnesota Vikings by the score of 23\u20137.

Justices have life tenure, and so they serve until they die in office, resign or retire, or are impeached and removed from office. Justices are nominated by the president and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate. A nomination to the Court is considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate's record. There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Of these, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress.

The court has seven members, a chief justice and six associate justices, each serving six-year terms. Since 2004, the court has met in the Thomas J. Moyer Ohio Judicial Center (formerly known as the Ohio Departments Building) on the east bank of the Scioto River in downtown Columbus. Prior to 2004, the court met in the James A. Rhodes State Office Tower and earlier in the Judiciary Annex (now the Senate Building) of the Ohio Statehouse. The Ohio Supreme Court and the rest of the judiciary is established and authorized within Article IV of the Ohio Constitution. All the seats on the court are elected at large by the voters of Ohio. Every two years, two of the associate justice seats are up for election. For one of those three elections in a cycle, the chief justice's seat is up for election. In order to run for a seat on the court, a person must be admitted to the bar in Ohio, and have practiced as a lawyer or served as a judge for at least six years. There is an age limit: One may not run for a seat on any Ohio court if one is more than 70 years of age. | wikipage: Supreme Court of Texas text: Supreme Court of Texas\n\nThe Supreme Court of Texas (\"SCOTX\") is the court of last resort for civil appeals (including juvenile delinquency which the law considers to be a civil matter and not criminal) in the U.S. state of Texas.

It was established in 1846 to replace the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas. The Court meets in Downtown Austin, Texas in a building located on the state Capitol grounds, behind the Texas State Capitol. By statute, the Texas Supreme Court has administrative control over the State Bar of Texas, an agency of the judiciary.

A nomination to the Court is considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate's record. There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Of these, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court.",

The Ohio Supreme Court and the rest of the judiciary is established and authorized within Article IV of the Ohio Constitution. All the seats on the court are elected at large by the voters of Ohio. Every two years, two of the associate justice seats are up for election. For one of those three elections in a cycle, the chief justice's seat is up for election. In order to run for a seat on the court, a person must be admitted to the bar in Ohio, and have practiced as a lawyer or served as a judge for at least six years.

Among the most costly of these offensives were the Battle of Verdun, in 1916, with a combined 700,000 casualties (estimated), the Battle of the Somme, also in 1916, with more than a million casualties (estimated), and the Battle of Passchendaele (Third Battle of Ypres), in 1917, with 487,000 casualties (estimated).",

In different cultures different positions of urination are employed. Sitting and squatting are also options to standing to urinate. Also in the elderly male with prostate problems sitting down is preferable. For practising Muslim men, the genital modesty of squatting is also associated with proper cleanliness requirements or awrah. The female external urethral orifice is the external opening of the urethra, from which urine is ejected during urination. It is located about 2.5\u00a0cm behind the clitoris and immediately in front of the vagina in the vulval vestibule. It usually assumes the form of a short, sagittal cleft with slightly raised margins. To its left and right are the openings of the Skene's glands. Some evidence exists to suggest that the clitoral-urinary meatus distance (CUMD) in human females relates to the ease with which she may achieve orgasm through penetrative sex.

Nearby are the openings of the Skene's ducts. The vaginal orifice is a median slit below and behind the opening of the urethra; its size varies inversely with that of the hymen.

It was the tenth Open Championship at Royal Birkdale, which held its first in 1954. Jordan Spieth shot four rounds under 70 for a score of 268, three strokes ahead of runner-up Matt Kuchar. It was Spieth's second wire-to-wire win at a major, following his 2015 Masters win. In the third round, Branden Grace scored 62, which set a new major championship record. This was the first year that the prize money was paid in U.S. dollars rather than British pounds. This was the second Open Championship televised domestically by Sky Sports. In the United States, it is the second Open Championship to be televised by NBC (Golf Channel's parent network). The 2017 event was the tenth Open Championship played at the Royal Birkdale Golf Club.

In April 2016, \"Time\" magazine named Spieth to its list of the \"100 Most Influential People\", noting that he \"exemplifies everything that's great about sports.\" Spieth's first major win came in the 2015 Masters Tournament, when he shot a 270 (\u221218) and pocketed $1.8 million. He tied the 72-hole record set by Tiger Woods in 1997 and became the second youngest golfer (behind Woods) to win the Masters. He then won the 2015 U.S. Open with a score of 5-under-par. He was the youngest U.S. Open champion since amateur Bobby Jones in 1923. He followed up with a win in the 2015 Tour Championship, which clinched the 2015 FedEx Cup.

The song was written by band members Timothy B. Schmit, Glenn Frey, and Don Henley. Recorded in March 1978, it was the first song finished for the album and the first Eagles song to feature Schmit on lead vocals. The studio version became a \"Billboard\" Top 10 hit in April 1980, reaching number 8 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 3 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It is their last Top Ten hit on the Hot 100. Timothy B. Schmit came up with the song title and composed the nucleus of \"I Can't Tell You Why\", which he then presented to Glenn Frey and Don Henley and they completed the song together. Henley described the finished song as \"straight Al Green\", and that Frey, an R&B fan as he came from Detroit and grew up with the music, was responsible for the R&B feel of the song. Frey said to Schmit: \"You could sing like Smokey Robinson. Let\u2019s not do a Richie Furay, Poco-sounding song. Let\u2019s do an R&B song.\" | wikipage: I Can't Tell You Why text: Schmit describes the song as \"loosely based on my own experiences\".

I had [composed] a pretty good part of it, not a huge part but enough for them to think 'That could be good' and go with it. So Don, Glenn and I finished it over a few all night sessions.\" \"When it was being developed in the studio...I knew it was a great song. I [thought] 'Yes! This is an amazing debut for me.' When we finally mixed it, we had a little listening party at the studio. As people were hearing it, Don turned to me and said, 'There's your first hit.'\" Schmit sang the lead vocals on the song, with Frey and Henley singing counterpoint.

The song was written by band members Timothy B. Schmit, Glenn Frey, and Don Henley. Recorded in March 1978, it was the first song finished for the album and the first Eagles song to feature Schmit on lead vocals. The studio version became a \"Billboard\" Top 10 hit in April 1980, reaching number 8 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 3 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It is their last Top Ten hit on the Hot 100. Timothy B. Schmit came up with the song title and composed the nucleus of \"I Can't Tell You Why\", which he then presented to Glenn Frey and Don Henley and they completed the song together. Henley described the finished song as \"straight Al Green\", and that Frey, an R&B fan as he came from Detroit and grew up with the music, was responsible for the R&B feel of the song. Frey said to Schmit: \"You could sing like Smokey Robinson. Let\u2019s not do a Richie Furay, Poco-sounding song. Let\u2019s do an R&B song.\"",

A 1,200-plane airborne assault preceded an amphibious assault involving more than 5,000 vessels. Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June, and more than two million Allied troops were in France by the end of August. The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion in 1944 was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), and General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group, which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion. The coast of Normandy of northwestern France was chosen as the site of the invasion, with the Americans assigned to land at sectors codenamed Utah and Omaha, the British at Sword and Gold, and the Canadians at Juno.

The multi-day holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and help support their spiritual journey. In 2008, the tradition was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. The holiday is sometimes called D\u00eda de los Muertos in Anglophone countries, a back-translation of its original name, \"D\u00eda de Muertos\". It is particularly celebrated in Mexico where the day is a public holiday. Prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century, the celebration took place at the beginning of summer. Gradually, it was associated with October 31, November 1, and November 2 to coincide with the Western Christianity triduum of Allhallowtide: All Saints' Eve, All Saints' Day, and All Souls' Day. Traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars called \"ofrendas\", honoring the deceased using calaveras, aztec marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts. Visitors also leave possessions of the deceased at the graves. | wikipage: Halloween text: In Scotland and Ireland, traditional Halloween customs include children dressing up in costume going \"guising\", holding parties, while other practices in Ireland include lighting bonfires, and having firework displays. In Brittany children would play practical jokes by setting candles inside skulls in graveyards to frighten visitors. Mass transatlantic immigration in the 19th century popularized Halloween in North America, and celebration in the United States and Canada has had a significant impact on how the event is observed in other nations. This larger North American influence, particularly in iconic and commercial elements, has extended to places such as Ecuador, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, (most) continental Europe, Japan, and other parts of East Asia.

Gradually, it was associated with October 31, November 1, and November 2 to coincide with the Western Christianity triduum of Allhallowtide: All Saints' Eve, All Saints' Day, and All Souls' Day. Traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars called \"ofrendas\", honoring the deceased using calaveras, aztec marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts. Visitors also leave possessions of the deceased at the graves.",

Mass transatlantic immigration in the 19th century popularized Halloween in North America, and celebration in the United States and Canada has had a significant impact on how the event is observed in other nations. This larger North American influence, particularly in iconic and commercial elements, has extended to places such as Ecuador, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, (most) continental Europe, Japan, and other parts of East Asia.

There is some variation by viewer demographics. Men, show a stronger preference for football than women, conservatives a stronger preference than liberals, and those over 35 a stronger preference than those under 35. In all groups, however, football is still the most popular. Basketball and soccer are more popular among liberals than conservatives. Though baseball has historically been called the \"national pastime\", American football has considerably grown in popularity with the advent of television over the last several decades. | wikipage: Sports in the United States text: International competition is not as important in American sports as it is in the sporting culture of most other countries, although Olympic ice hockey and basketball tournaments do generate attention. The first international baseball tournament with top-level players, the World Baseball Classic, also generated some positive reviews after its inaugural tournament in 2006. The major professional sports leagues operate drafts once a year, in which each league's teams selected eligible prospects. Eligibility differs from league to league. Baseball and ice hockey operate minor league systems for players who have finished education but are not ready or good enough for the major leagues. The NBA also has a development league for players who are not ready to play at the top level. The extent to which sports are associated with secondary and tertiary education in the United States is rare among nations. Millions of students participate in athletics programs operated by high schools and colleges. Student-athletes often receive scholarships to colleges in recognition of their athletic potential. Currently, the largest governing body of collegiate sports is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Especially in football and basketball, college sports are followed in numbers equaling those of professional sports. College football games can draw over 100,000 spectators.

The most popular competitive sport (and fifth most popular recreational sport) is bowling (43 million). Other most popular sports are fishing (35 million), bicycling (37 million), weightlifting (33 million), aerobics (30 million), and hiking (28 million). According to a January 2018 Poll by Gallup, 37% of Americans consider American football their favorite spectator sport, while 11% prefer basketball, 9% baseball, and 7% soccer. There is some variation by viewer demographics. Men, show a stronger preference for football than women, conservatives a stronger preference than liberals, and those over 35 a stronger preference than those under 35. In all groups, however, football is still the most popular. Basketball and soccer are more popular among liberals than conservatives. Though baseball has historically been called the \"national pastime\", American football has considerably grown in popularity with the advent of television over the last several decades.",

The first international baseball tournament with top-level players, the World Baseball Classic, also generated some positive reviews after its inaugural tournament in 2006. The major professional sports leagues operate drafts once a year, in which each league's teams selected eligible prospects. Eligibility differs from league to league. Baseball and ice hockey operate minor league systems for players who have finished education but are not ready or good enough for the major leagues. The NBA also has a development league for players who are not ready to play at the top level. The extent to which sports are associated with secondary and tertiary education in the United States is rare among nations. Millions of students participate in athletics programs operated by high schools and colleges. Student-athletes often receive scholarships to colleges in recognition of their athletic potential. Currently, the largest governing body of collegiate sports is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Especially in football and basketball, college sports are followed in numbers equaling those of professional sports. College football games can draw over 100,000 spectators.

By contrast, the United States' team\u2014led by head coach Herb Brooks\u2014consisted exclusively of amateur players, and was the youngest team in the tournament and in U.S. national team history. In the group stage, both the Soviet and U.S. teams were unbeaten; the U.S. achieved several notable results, including a 2\u20132 draw against Sweden, and a 7\u20133 upset victory over second-place favorites Czechoslovakia. For the first game in the medal round, the United States played the Soviets. Finishing the first period tied at 2\u20132, and the Soviets leading 3\u20132 following the second, the U.S. team scored two more goals to take their first lead during the third and final period, winning the game 4\u20133. Following the game, the U.S. went on to clinch the gold medal by beating Finland in the final.",

It formally placed the District of Columbia under the control of the United States Congress and organized the unincorporated territory within the District into two counties: Washington County to the north and east of the Potomac River and Alexandria County to the west and south. The charters of the existing cities of Georgetown and Alexandria were left in place and no change was made to their status. The common law of both Maryland and Virginia remained in force within the District. A court was established in each of the new counties. On May 3, 1802, the City of Washington was granted a municipal government consisting of a mayor appointed by the President of the United States. The portion of the District of Columbia ceded by Virginia was returned to that state in 1846-47. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871 replaced the municipal governments of the City of Washington, Georgetown, and Washington County with a single, unified government for the whole District.

After adopting the Articles of Confederation in York, Pennsylvania, the Congress of the Confederation was formed and convened in Philadelphia from March 1781 until June 1783, when a mob of angry soldiers converged upon Independence Hall, demanding payment for their service during the American Revolutionary War. Congress requested that John Dickinson, the Governor of Pennsylvania, call up the militia to defend Congress from attacks by the protesters. In what became known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, Dickinson sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from Philadelphia. As a result, Congress was forced to flee to Princeton, New Jersey, on June 21, 1783, and met in Annapolis, Maryland, and Trenton, New Jersey, before ending up in New York City. The United States Congress was established upon ratification of the United States Constitution and formally began on March 4, 1789. New York City remained home to Congress until July 1790, when the Residence Act was passed to pave the way for a permanent capital.

New England finished with a 14\u20132 record, equaling their 2003 record and the best regular-season record ever for a defending champion. The Patriots also won the AFC East divisional title for the third time in four years. Brady threw for 3,692 yards and 28 touchdowns, with a 92.6 passer rating, and was voted to his second Pro Bowl.

The 28th Disney animated feature film, \"The Little Mermaid\" was released to theaters on November 17, 1989 to largely positive reviews, garnering $84 million at the domestic box office during its initial release, and $211 million in total lifetime gross worldwide. After the success of the 1988 Disney/Amblin film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", \"The Little Mermaid\" is given credit for breathing life back into the art of Disney animated feature films after a string of critical or commercial failures produced by Disney that dated back to the early 1970s.

It was first published in 1963 and was written by Norman Bridwell (1928\u20132014). Bridwell himself had a dog he based the stories on, however his pet canine was neither big nor red. The series helped establish Scholastic as a premier publishing company, and Clifford himself is Scholastic's official mascot. In 1988, Scholastic Studios, Mendelson-Melendez Productions, Nelvana, Wang Film Productions, and Family Home Entertainment released \"Clifford's Fun with...\", a videotape series with the theme song by Phillip Namanworth and Benjamin Goldstein. These episodes include the following: \"The ABC Message Service\", \"Clifford's Birthday Surprise\", \"The Scavenger Hunt\", \"The Rhyme Cat Rescue\", \"Clifford Goes to Hollywood\", and \"The Pet Show\". Brent Titcomb voiced Clifford, and Emily Elizabeth was voiced by Alyson Court. Karl-Lorimar Home Video released the video \"Clifford's Sing Along Adventure\" around the same time. Warner Home Video re-released it in the mid-1990s.

Produced by Scholastic Productions, it originally aired on PBS Kids from September 4, 2000 to February 25, 2003. The UK version (where it was dubbed with British voice actors replacing the original American soundtrack) originally aired on BBC 2 on 1 April 2002. John Ritter voiced Clifford in all episodes. This was originally done by Brent Titcomb in the 1988 direct-to-video series. Generally speaking, Ritter's schedule dictated the production of \"Clifford the Big Red Dog\" . By the time the last of the 68 half-hour episodes and the subsequent film \"Clifford's Really Big Movie\" were completed, Ritter was back on ABC's prime-time schedule, starring in \"8 Simple Rules\". Ritter's death on September 11, 2003 came less than a week before PBS debuted \"Clifford's Puppy Days\", a show that kept Clifford's legacy going. While no new \"Clifford\" episodes have been released since Ritter's death in 2003, voice actors for the main characters have reprised some of their roles for the \"Ready to Learn\" PBS Kids PSAs. | wikipage: Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series) text: \"Clifford's Really Big Movie\" serves as the series finale due to Ritter's death, as no new episodes were made to continue from where it left off. However, \"Clifford's Puppy Days\" still continued to air until its cancellation in 2006. On May 16, 2018, Scholastic announced a reboot of the series and is scheduled for a late 2019 premiere concurrently on PBS Kids and Amazon Prime. Two 15-minute stories made up each half-hour episode. Usually one story featured Clifford and his canine friends, Cleo and T-Bone among them; the other story would focus on Clifford's owner Emily Elizabeth and her friends. During scenes focusing on the dog character's perspective, human speech would replace barking to engage viewers in the storyline from the dogs' point of view. This series was produced by Mike Young Productions and Scholastic Studios. The TV series takes place in the fictional island of Birdwell Island, where Clifford lives. The name is inspired by Norman Bridwell, the author of the books, but the letters I and R are switched. It is based on Martha's Vineyard, where Bridwell lived. Emily Elizabeth used to live in an apartment in New York City, but she moved away with her parents and Clifford to Birdwell Island because her mother told her that a small apartment is no place for a big dog like Clifford.",

It was first published in 1963 and was written by Norman Bridwell (1928\u20132014). Bridwell himself had a dog he based the stories on, however his pet canine was neither big nor red. The series helped establish Scholastic as a premier publishing company, and Clifford himself is Scholastic's official mascot. In 1988, Scholastic Studios, Mendelson-Melendez Productions, Nelvana, Wang Film Productions, and Family Home Entertainment released \"Clifford's Fun with...\", a videotape series with the theme song by Phillip Namanworth and Benjamin Goldstein. These episodes include the following: \"The ABC Message Service\", \"Clifford's Birthday Surprise\", \"The Scavenger Hunt\", \"The Rhyme Cat Rescue\", \"Clifford Goes to Hollywood\", and \"The Pet Show\". Brent Titcomb voiced Clifford, and Emily Elizabeth was voiced by Alyson Court. Karl-Lorimar Home Video released the video \"Clifford's Sing Along Adventure\" around the same time. Warner Home Video re-released it in the mid-1990s. Scholastic Studios produced a 65-episode adaptation shown on PBS Kids, which aired from September 2000 to February 2003.",

Produced by Scholastic Productions, it originally aired on PBS Kids from September 4, 2000 to February 25, 2003. The UK version (where it was dubbed with British voice actors replacing the original American soundtrack) originally aired on BBC 2 on 1 April 2002. John Ritter voiced Clifford in all episodes. This was originally done by Brent Titcomb in the 1988 direct-to-video series. Generally speaking, Ritter's schedule dictated the production of \"Clifford the Big Red Dog\" . By the time the last of the 68 half-hour episodes and the subsequent film \"Clifford's Really Big Movie\" were completed, Ritter was back on ABC's prime-time schedule, starring in \"8 Simple Rules\". Ritter's death on September 11, 2003 came less than a week before PBS debuted \"Clifford's Puppy Days\", a show that kept Clifford's legacy going. While no new \"Clifford\" episodes have been released since Ritter's death in 2003, voice actors for the main characters have reprised some of their roles for the \"Ready to Learn\" PBS Kids PSAs.",

However, \"Clifford's Puppy Days\" still continued to air until its cancellation in 2006. On May 16, 2018, Scholastic announced a reboot of the series and is scheduled for a late 2019 premiere concurrently on PBS Kids and Amazon Prime. Two 15-minute stories made up each half-hour episode. Usually one story featured Clifford and his canine friends, Cleo and T-Bone among them; the other story would focus on Clifford's owner Emily Elizabeth and her friends. During scenes focusing on the dog character's perspective, human speech would replace barking to engage viewers in the storyline from the dogs' point of view. This series was produced by Mike Young Productions and Scholastic Studios. The TV series takes place in the fictional island of Birdwell Island, where Clifford lives. The name is inspired by Norman Bridwell, the author of the books, but the letters I and R are switched. It is based on Martha's Vineyard, where Bridwell lived. Emily Elizabeth used to live in an apartment in New York City, but she moved away with her parents and Clifford to Birdwell Island because her mother told her that a small apartment is no place for a big dog like Clifford.",

This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water \u2013 hence the name \"photosynthesis\", from the Greek \u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2, \"ph\u014ds\", \"light\", and \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, \"synthesis\", \"putting together\". In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product. Most plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for life on Earth. Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. | wikipage: Chloroplast text: Chloroplast\n\nChloroplasts are organelles that conduct photosynthesis, where the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll captures the energy from sunlight, converts it, and stores it in the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH while freeing oxygen from water in plant and algal cells. They then use the ATP and NADPH to make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process known as the Calvin cycle. Chloroplasts carry out a number of other functions, including fatty acid synthesis, much amino acid synthesis, and the immune response in plants. The number of chloroplasts per cell varies from one, in unicellular algae, up to 100 in plants like \"Arabidopsis\" and wheat. A chloroplast is a type of organelle known as a plastid, characterized by its two membranes and a high concentration of chlorophyll. Other plastid types, such as the leucoplast and the chromoplast, contain little chlorophyll and do not carry out photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are highly dynamic\u2014they circulate and are moved around within plant cells, and occasionally pinch in two to reproduce. Their behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like light color and intensity. | wikipage: Cell membrane text: Cell membrane\n\nThe cell membrane (also known as the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic membrane, and historically referred to as the plasmalemma) is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment (the extracellular space) which protects the cell from its environment consisting of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins. The cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of cells and organelles. In this way, it is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules. In addition, cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion, ion conductivity and cell signalling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures, including the cell wall, the carbohydrate layer called the glycocalyx, and the intracellular network of protein fibers called the cytoskeleton. In the field of synthetic biology, cell membranes can be artificially reassembled. While Robert Hooke\u2019s discovery of cells in 1665 led to the proposal of the Cell Theory, Hooke misled the cell membrane theory that all cells contained a hard cell wall since only plant cells could be observed at the time.

There is also a monument to Arthur Ashe, a Richmond native and international tennis star who was African-American. The first monument, a statue of Robert E. Lee, was erected in 1890. Between 1900 and 1925, Monument Avenue greatly expanded with architecturally significant houses, churches and apartment buildings. Monument Avenue is the site of several annual events, particularly in the spring, including an annual Monument Avenue 10K race. At various times (such as Robert E. Lee's birthday and Confederate History Month) the Sons of Confederate Veterans gather along Monument Avenue in period military costumes. Monument Avenue is also the site of \"Easter on Parade,\" another spring tradition during which many Richmonders stroll the avenue wearing Easter bonnets and other finery. \"Monument Avenue Historic District\" includes the part of Monument Avenue beginning at the termination of West Franklin Street at Stuart Circle in the east, extending westward for some fourteen blocks to Roseneath Avenue, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark District.",

The forward pass is one of the main distinguishers between gridiron football (American football and Canadian football) in which the play is legal and widespread, and rugby football (union and league) from which the North American games evolved, in which the play is illegal. In some football codes, such as association football (soccer), the kicked forward pass is used so ubiquitously that it is not thought of as a distinct kind of play at all.

Her parents were both in prison at the time, and she was adopted and raised as an only child by her uncle Sam Sweetin and his second wife Janice when she was nine months old. The adoption was not formalized until she was two years old because her birth father was one-fourth Native American.

Its membership is the largest of the three BSA divisions (Cub Scouting, Boy Scouting, and Venturing). Cub Scouting is part of the worldwide Scouting movement and aims to promote character development, citizenship training, personal fitness, and leadership. As early as 1911, Ernest Thompson Seton had developed a prototype program he named \"Cub Scouts of America\" that was never implemented. James E. West felt that having BSA divisions for younger boys (those under 12; the \"younger boy problem\") would draw away boys from the core program, which was Scout troops focused on the 12- to 17-year-old age group; thus he opposed such a program for some time. In spite of this, unofficial programs for younger boys started around this time, under names such as \"Junior Troops\" or \"Cadet Corps\".

The 12 regions followed the organization of the federal reserve system at that time. In 1972, the 12 regions were consolidated into a new alignment of six geographic regions (Northeast, East Central, Southeast, North Central, South Central, and Western).

He is perhaps best remembered for his performance in the 1934 All-Star Game, when he struck out five of the game's great hitters in succession. Hubbell's primary pitch was the screwball. Hubbell was born in Carthage, Missouri and raised in Meeker, Oklahoma. He was originally signed by the Detroit Tigers and was invited to spring training in 1926. However, pitching coach George McBride and player-manager Ty Cobb weren't impressed with him. Additionally, they were concerned about his reliance on a screwball, a pitch that some believe places an unusual amount of stress on a pitcher's arm. Hubbell was sent to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the International League before the start of the season.",

In the early 20th century, two wings were added, leading to its present appearance. In 1960, it was designated a National Historic Landmark. During the American Colonial period, Virginia's first capital was Jamestown, where the first legislative body, the Virginia House of Burgesses, met in 1619. The new government used four state houses at different times at Jamestown due to fires. The first Representative Legislative Assembly convened on July 30, 1619 at the Jamestown Church which served as the first Capitol. With the decision to relocate the government inland to Williamsburg in 1699, a grand new Capitol building was completed in November 1705. Nearby was the grand Governor's Palace.",

Dip-slip faults can be either \"normal\" (\"extensional\") or \"reverse\". In a normal fault, the hanging wall moves downward, relative to the footwall. A downthrown block between two normal faults dipping towards each other is a graben. An upthrown block between two normal faults dipping away from each other is a horst.

The dip of a reverse fault is relatively steep, greater than 45\u00b0. The terminology of \"normal\" and \"reverse\" comes from coal-mining in England, where normal faults are the most common. A thrust fault has the same sense of motion as a reverse fault, but with the dip of the fault plane at less than 45\u00b0. | wikipage: Fault (geology) text: Fault (geology)\n\nIn geology, a fault is a planar fracture or discontinuity in a volume of rock, across which there has been significant displacement as a result of rock-mass movement. Large faults within the Earth's crust result from the action of plate tectonic forces, with the largest forming the boundaries between the plates, such as subduction zones or transform faults. Energy release associated with rapid movement on active faults is the cause of most earthquakes. A \"fault plane\" is the plane that represents the fracture surface of a fault. A \"fault trace \" or \"fault line\" is a place where the fault can be seen or mapped on the surface. A fault trace is also the line commonly plotted on geologic maps to represent a fault. Since faults do not usually consist of a single, clean fracture, geologists use the term fault zone when referring to the zone of complex deformation associated with the fault plane. Because of friction and the rigidity of the constituent rocks, the two sides of a fault cannot always glide or flow past each other easily, and so occasionally all movement stops. The regions of higher friction along a fault plane, where it becomes locked, are called \"asperities\". | wikipage: Fault (geology) text: Thrust faults typically form ramps, flats and fault-bend (hanging wall and foot wall) folds. Flat segments of thrust fault planes are known as \"flats\", and inclined sections of the thrust are known as \"ramps\". Typically, thrust faults move \"within\" formations by forming flats and climb up sections with ramps. Fault-bend folds are formed by movement of the hanging wall over a non-planar fault surface and are found associated with both extensional and thrust faults. Faults may be reactivated at a later time with the movement in the opposite direction to the original movement (fault inversion). A normal fault may therefore become a reverse fault and vice versa.

They also had UK hits from the albums \"Wha'ppen?\" and \"Special Beat Service\". In 1983, The Beat disbanded, citing \"every great band only has three really good albums\". Wakeling then formed General Public with Ranking Roger in 1984, and they released their debut album \"All the Rage\". He recorded two other albums with General Public, \"Hand To Mouth\" (1986) and \"Rub It Better\" (1995), shortly after which the act disbanded. He then produced the soundtrack for the John Hughes film \"She's Having a Baby\" (1988), in which he also recorded the title track. Wakeling released \"No Warning\", a solo album, on I.R.S.

Beijing was elected as the host city in July 2015 at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

These Games will also be the fourth Winter Olympics to be held in East Asia, after Sapporo (1972), Nagano (1998) and Pyeongchang (2018). Beijing will become the first city ever to host both Summer and Winter Olympic Games. There are plans to utilize many of the same indoor venues that were used in 2008, as well as using the Beijing National Stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies.

The dual function of excretory systems is the elimination of the waste products of metabolism and to drain the body of used up and broken down components in a liquid and gaseous state. In humans and other amniotes (mammals, birds and reptiles) most of these substances leave the body as urine and to some degree exhalation, mammals also expel them through sweating. Only the organs specifically used for the excretion are considered a part of the excretory system. In the narrow sense, the term refer to the urinary system. However, as excretion involves several functions that are only superficially related, it is not usually used in more formal classifications of anatomy or function. As most healthy functioning organs produce metabolic and other wastes, the entire organism depends on the function of the system. Breaking down of one of more of the systems is a serious health condition, for example renal failure. The kidneys are bean-shaped organs which are present on each side of the vertebral column in the abdominal cavity.

Within each nephron, information from the renal tubules (a downstream area of the tubular fluid) is signaled to the glomerulus (an upstream area). Tubuloglomerular feedback is one of several mechanisms the kidney uses to regulate glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It involves the concept of purinergic signaling, in which an increased distal tubular sodium chloride concentration causes a basolateral release of adenosine from the macula densa cells. This initiates a cascade of events that ultimately brings GFR to an appropriate level. The kidney maintains the electrolyte concentrations, osmolality, and acid-base balance of blood plasma within the narrow limits that are compatible with effective cellular function; and the kidney participates in blood pressure regulation and in the maintenance of steady whole-organism water volume \n\nFluid flow through the nephron must be kept within a narrow range for normal renal function in order to not compromise the ability of the nephron to maintain salt and water balance.

Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson in their directorial debuts, it stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow as the voices of the lead characters. The film parodies other films adapted from fairy tale storylines, primarily aimed at animated Disney films. In the story, Shrek (Myers) finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures who have been banished by a corrupt Lord Farquaad (Lithgow) aspiring to be king. Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad to regain control of his swamp in return for rescuing Princess Fiona (Diaz), whom he intends to marry. With the help of Donkey (Murphy), Shrek embarks on his quest but soon falls in love with the princess, who is hiding a secret that will change his life forever. The rights to Steig's book were purchased by Steven Spielberg in 1991. He originally planned to produce a traditionally-animated film based on the book, but John H. Williams convinced him to bring the film to the newly-founded DreamWorks in 1994.

Rose, wearing a red sport coat, appeared on the field in front of the pitcher's mound before the game and received a standing ovation alongside former teammates Johnny Bench, Barry Larkin, and Joe Morgan.",

The Marlins initially were slated to host the 2000 All-Star Game, prior to having it revoked by then-National League president Len Coleman due to the concerns of both the franchise's long-term viability in the South Florida market, along with the habitually low attendance figures at Pro Player Stadium.

Power pitchers usually record a high number of strikeouts, and statistics such as strikeouts per 9 innings pitched are common measures of power. An average pitcher strikes out about 5 batters per nine innings while a power pitcher will often strike out one or more every inning. The prototypical power pitcher is National Baseball Hall of Fame member, Nolan Ryan, who struck out a Major League Baseball record 5,714 batters in 5,386 innings. Ryan recorded seven no-hitters, appeared in eight Major League Baseball All-Star Games but also holds the record for most walks issued (2,795). A famous fictional example of a power pitcher is Ricky \"Wild Thing\" Vaughn from the film \"Major League\", a character sports journalist Scott Lauber once called \"the power pitcher everyone on my high school baseball team wished they were\". Actor Charlie Sheen performed that role; he had actually played baseball earlier in his life, prior to acting, as a pitcher. Additional, non-fictional prominent power pitchers include Hall of Famers Walter Johnson, Bob Gibson, Sandy Koufax, Randy Johnson and Bob Feller. Feller himself famously led his league in strikeouts and walks several times. | wikipage: NCAA Division I softball career strikeouts list text: Cat Osterman set the single season strikeout ratio at 15.4 in 2006, she struck out 630 that season.

This statistic allows a defensive team to examine the opposing team's lineup for hitters who are more prone to strikeout. Such players, when batting, are typically more aggressive than the average hitter. This knowledge permits the pitcher to approach the batter with more pitching options, often throwing more balls out of the strike zone in the hope that the batter will swing and miss. The number of this statistic can be calculated by dividing a player's total number of plate appearances by their total number of strikeouts. For example, Reggie Jackson collected 2,597 strikeouts and 11,418 plate appearances in his 21-year baseball career, recording a 4.39 PA/SO, which suggests that for every 4.39 plate appearance Jackson had one strikeout.",

More than 450 translations into English have been written. The New Revised Standard Version is the version most commonly preferred by biblical scholars. In the United States, 55% of survey respondents who read the Bible reported using the King James Version in 2014, followed by 19% for the New International Version, with other versions used by fewer than 10%. Although John Wycliffe is often credited with the first translation of the Bible into English, there were in fact many translations of large parts of the Bible centuries before Wycliffe's work. Parts of the Bible were first translated from the Latin Vulgate into Old English by a few select monks and scholars. Such translations were generally in the form of prose or as interlinear glosses (literal translations above the Latin words). Very few complete translations existed during that time. Most of the books of the Bible existed separately and were read as individual texts. Thus the sense of the Bible as history that often exists today did not exist at that time. Instead, an allegorical rendering of the Bible was more common and translations of the Bible often included the writer\u2019s own commentary on passages in addition to the literal translation. | wikipage: Bible translations into English text: This, the first major period of Bible translation into the English language, began with the introduction of the Tyndale Bible. The first complete edition of his New Testament was in 1526. William Tyndale used the Greek and Hebrew texts of the New Testament (NT) and Old Testament (OT) in addition to Jerome's Latin translation. He was the first translator to use the printing press \u2013 this enabled the distribution of several thousand copies of his New Testament translation throughout England. Tyndale did not complete his Old Testament translation. The first printed English translation of the whole bible was produced by Miles Coverdale in 1535, using Tyndale's work together with his own translations from the Latin Vulgate or German text. After much scholarly debate it is concluded that this was printed in Antwerp and the colophon gives the date as 4 October 1535. This first edition was adapted by Coverdale for his first \"authorised version\", known as the Great Bible, of 1539. Other early printed versions were the Geneva Bible (1560), notable for being the first Bible divided into verses and which negated the Divine Right of Kings; the Bishop's Bible (1568), which was an attempt by Elizabeth I to create a new authorised version; and the Authorized King James Version of 1611. | wikipage: Early Modern English Bible translations text: Early Modern English Bible translations\n\nEarly Modern English Bible translations are those translations of the Bible which were made between about 1500 and 1800, the period of Early Modern English. This was the first major period of Bible translation into the English language including the King James Version and Douai Bibles. The Reformation and Counter-Reformation led to the need for Bibles in the vernacular with competing groups each producing their own versions. Although Wycliffe's Bible had preceded the Protestant Reformation, England was actually one of the last countries in Europe to have a printed vernacular Bible. There were several reasons for this. One was that Henry VIII wanted to avoid the propagation of heresies\u2014a concern subsequently justified by the marginal notes printed in Tyndale's New Testament and the Geneva Bible, for example. Another was the Roman Catholic doctrine of Magisterium which describes the Church as the final authority in the interpretation of the Scriptures; in the volatile years of the Reformation, it was not felt that encouraging private Scriptural interpretation, and thereby possible heresy, would be helpful. Several of the early printed English Bibles were suppressed, at least temporarily. Henry VIII complained about Tyndale's \"pestilent glosses\", and only tolerated the Coverdale and Matthew Bibles because the publishers carefully omitted any mention of Tyndale's involvement in them.",

Such translations were generally in the form of prose or as interlinear glosses (literal translations above the Latin words). Very few complete translations existed during that time. Most of the books of the Bible existed separately and were read as individual texts. Thus the sense of the Bible as history that often exists today did not exist at that time. Instead, an allegorical rendering of the Bible was more common and translations of the Bible often included the writer\u2019s own commentary on passages in addition to the literal translation.",

The first complete edition of his New Testament was in 1526. William Tyndale used the Greek and Hebrew texts of the New Testament (NT) and Old Testament (OT) in addition to Jerome's Latin translation. He was the first translator to use the printing press \u2013 this enabled the distribution of several thousand copies of his New Testament translation throughout England. Tyndale did not complete his Old Testament translation. The first printed English translation of the whole bible was produced by Miles Coverdale in 1535, using Tyndale's work together with his own translations from the Latin Vulgate or German text. After much scholarly debate it is concluded that this was printed in Antwerp and the colophon gives the date as 4 October 1535. This first edition was adapted by Coverdale for his first \"authorised version\", known as the Great Bible, of 1539. Other early printed versions were the Geneva Bible (1560), notable for being the first Bible divided into verses and which negated the Divine Right of Kings; the Bishop's Bible (1568), which was an attempt by Elizabeth I to create a new authorised version; and the Authorized King James Version of 1611.",

This was the first major period of Bible translation into the English language including the King James Version and Douai Bibles. The Reformation and Counter-Reformation led to the need for Bibles in the vernacular with competing groups each producing their own versions. Although Wycliffe's Bible had preceded the Protestant Reformation, England was actually one of the last countries in Europe to have a printed vernacular Bible. There were several reasons for this. One was that Henry VIII wanted to avoid the propagation of heresies\u2014a concern subsequently justified by the marginal notes printed in Tyndale's New Testament and the Geneva Bible, for example. Another was the Roman Catholic doctrine of Magisterium which describes the Church as the final authority in the interpretation of the Scriptures; in the volatile years of the Reformation, it was not felt that encouraging private Scriptural interpretation, and thereby possible heresy, would be helpful. Several of the early printed English Bibles were suppressed, at least temporarily. Henry VIII complained about Tyndale's \"pestilent glosses\", and only tolerated the Coverdale and Matthew Bibles because the publishers carefully omitted any mention of Tyndale's involvement in them.",

Symptoms often include mild to moderate intellectual disability. The average IQ in males is under 55. Physical features may include a long and narrow face, large ears, flexible fingers, and large testicles. About a third of those affected have features of autism such as problems with social interactions and delayed speech. Hyperactivity is common and seizures occur in about 10%. Males are usually more affected than females. Fragile X syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. Women with a premutation have an increased risk of having an affected child. It is typically due to an expansion of the CGG triplet repeat within the \"Fragile X mental retardation 1\" (\"FMR1\") gene on the X chromosome. This results in not enough fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is required for the normal development of connections between neurons. Diagnosis is by genetic testing to determine the number of CGG repeats in the \"FMR1\" gene. Normal is between 5 and 40 repeats, fragile X syndrome occurs with more than 200, and a premutation is said to be present when a middle number of repeats occurs. Testing for premutation carriers may allow for genetic counseling. There is no cure. Early intervention is recommended as it provides the most opportunity for developing a full range of skills. | wikipage: Dynamic mutation text: Dynamic mutation\n\nIn genetics, a dynamic mutation is an unstable heritable element where the probability of expression of a mutant phenotype is a function of the number of copies of the mutation. That is, the replication product (progeny) of a dynamic mutation has a different likelihood of mutation than its predecessor. These mutations, typically short sequences repeated many times, give rise to numerous known diseases, including the Trinucleotide repeat disorders. Robert I. Richards and Grant R. Sutherland called these phenomena, in the framework of dynamical genetics, dynamic mutations. Triplet expansion is caused by slippage during DNA replication. Due to the repetitive nature of the DNA sequence in these regions 'loop out' structures may form during DNA replication while maintaining complementary base pairing between the parent strand and daughter strand being synthesized. If the loop out structure is formed from sequence on the daughter strand this will result in an increase in the number of repeats. However, if the loop out structure is formed on the parent strand a decrease in the number of repeats occurs. It appears that expansion of these repeats is more common than reduction. Generally the larger the expansion the more likely they are to cause disease or increase the severity of disease. This property results in the characteristic of anticipation seen in trinucleotide repeat disorders.",

According to Wullschlager, the two men entered a relationship in the early 1860s that brought the poet \"some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness.\" It was the only homosexual affair during Andersen's life that brought him happiness. \"The Snowman\" begins with its eponymous hero standing in the garden of a manor house watching the sun set and the moon rise.

Wullschlager believes \"The Snowman\" was the product in part of Andersen\u2019s \"pining and discontent over\" Harald Scharff, a handsome young dancer at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen. According to Wullschlager, the two men entered a relationship in the early 1860s that brought the poet \"some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness.\" It was the only homosexual affair during Andersen's life that brought him happiness. \"The Snowman\" begins with its eponymous hero standing in the garden of a manor house watching the sun set and the moon rise. He is only a day old, and quite na\u00efve and inexperienced. His sole companion is a watchdog who warns him that the sun will make him run into the ditch. The dog senses a change in the weather, enters his kennel and goes to sleep.",

Mattis commissioned in the Marine Corps through the Reserve Officers' Training Corps after graduating from Central Washington University. A career soldier, he gained a reputation for intellectualism and eventually advanced to the rank of general. Mattis served in the Persian Gulf War, Afghanistan, and Iraq. From 2007 to 2010, he commanded the United States Joint Forces Command and concurrently served as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Transformation. His was Commander of United States Central Command from 2010 to 2013. After retiring from the military, he served in several private sector roles, including as a board member of Theranos. Mattis was nominated as Secretary of Defense by President-elect Trump and confirmed by the Senate on January 20, 2017. He needed a waiver from Congress to allow his nomination to be considered, as he had only been separated from the military for the previous three years despite U.S. federal law requiring at least seven years of retirement for former military personnel to be appointed Secretary of Defense. As Secretary of Defense, Mattis has affirmed the United States' commitment to defending longtime ally South Korea in the wake of the North Korea crisis. An opponent of proposed collaboration with Russia on military matters, Mattis has consistently stressed Russia's threat to the world order.",

Several other countries then followed in the early to mid-1980s. These first-generation (1G) systems could support far more simultaneous calls but still used analog cellular technology. In 1983, the DynaTAC 8000x was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone. In 1991, the second-generation (2G) digital cellular technology was launched in Finland by Radiolinja on the GSM standard. This sparked competition in the sector as the new operators challenged the incumbent 1G network operators. Ten years later, in 2001, the third generation (3G) was launched in Japan by NTT DoCoMo on the WCDMA standard. This was followed by 3.5G, 3G+ or turbo 3G enhancements based on the high-speed packet access (HSPA) family, allowing UMTS networks to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity. By 2009, it had become clear that, at some point, 3G networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth-intensive applications, such as streaming media. Consequently, the industry began looking to data-optimized fourth-generation technologies, with the promise of speed improvements up to ten-fold over existing 3G technologies. | wikipage: Mobile phone text: Mobile phone\n\nA mobile phone, cell phone or hand phone, sometimes shortened to simply mobile, cell or just phone, is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture, and, therefore, mobile telephones are called \"cellular telephones\" or \"cell phones\", in North America. In addition to telephony, 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, video games, and digital photography. Mobile phones offering only those capabilities are known as feature phones; mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones. The first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated by John F. Mitchell and Martin Cooper of Motorola in 1973, using a handset weighing c. 2\u00a0kilograms (4.4 lbs). In 1979, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) launched the world's first cellular network in Japan.

In 1983, the DynaTAC 8000x was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone. In 1991, the second-generation (2G) digital cellular technology was launched in Finland by Radiolinja on the GSM standard. This sparked competition in the sector as the new operators challenged the incumbent 1G network operators. Ten years later, in 2001, the third generation (3G) was launched in Japan by NTT DoCoMo on the WCDMA standard. This was followed by 3.5G, 3G+ or turbo 3G enhancements based on the high-speed packet access (HSPA) family, allowing UMTS networks to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity. By 2009, it had become clear that, at some point, 3G networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth-intensive applications, such as streaming media. Consequently, the industry began looking to data-optimized fourth-generation technologies, with the promise of speed improvements up to ten-fold over existing 3G technologies.",

The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture, and, therefore, mobile telephones are called \"cellular telephones\" or \"cell phones\", in North America. In addition to telephony, 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, video games, and digital photography. Mobile phones offering only those capabilities are known as feature phones; mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones. The first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated by John F. Mitchell and Martin Cooper of Motorola in 1973, using a handset weighing c. 2\u00a0kilograms (4.4 lbs). In 1979, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) launched the world's first cellular network in Japan. In 1983, the DynaTAC 8000x was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone.",

A married couple with income under \u20ac36,000 per year is also exempt if either spouse is aged 65 or over or reaches 65 during the year; the exemption amount is increased by \u20ac575 for each of the couple's first two dependent children and by \u20ac830 for each subsequent child. A person or couple earning slightly over the limit may claim what is known as marginal relief. In this case, income over the exemption limit is charged to tax at a flat rate of 40%. A person or couple may choose to be taxed under marginal relief or the regular tax system, and will be granted whichever system is more beneficial, including retroactively. Some items of expenditure can be deducted from a person's income for tax purposes, generally referred to as getting tax relief.

The Everly Brothers scored a number 8 hit single with \"When Will I Be Loved\" in the summer of 1960 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. The track had been recorded in 1960 while the duo were contracted to Cadence Records; by 1960 they had moved to Warner Brothers and recording in a more mainstream pop/rock style than previously. The belated release by Cadence of \"When Will I Be Loved\" provided the Everly Brothers with a final rockabilly-style hit. The session, produced by Archie Bleyer, took place on February 18, 1960 at the RCA Studio in Nashville.

The more experienced firemen were clamouring for demolition, but Bloodworth refused on the grounds that most premises were rented and the owners could not be found. Bloodworth is generally thought to have been appointed to the office of Lord Mayor as a yes man, rather than by possessing requisite capabilities for the job. He panicked when faced with a sudden emergency and, when pressed, made the oft-quoted remark, \"Pish! A woman could piss it out\", and left. After the City had been destroyed, Samuel Pepys looked back on the events and wrote in his diary on 7 September 1666: \"People do all the world over cry out of the simplicity [the stupidity] of my Lord Mayor in general; and more particularly in this business of the fire, laying it all upon him.\" Pepys was a senior official in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret.

John Evelyn's diary, or memoir, spanned the period of his adult life from 1640, when he was a student, to 1706, the year he died. He did not write daily at all times. The many volumes provide insight into life and events at a time before regular magazines or newspapers were published, making diaries of greater interest to modern historians than such works might have been at later periods. Evelyn's work covers art, culture and politics, including the execution of Charles I, Oliver Cromwell's rise and eventual natural death, the last Great Plague of London, and the Great Fire of London in 1666. Evelyn's posthumously \"rival\" diarist, Samuel Pepys, wrote a different kind of diary, covering a much shorter period, 1660\u20131669, but in much greater depth, within the same era. Over the years, Evelyn's Diary has been overshadowed by Pepys's chronicles of 17th-century life.

This franchise will play their home games at SDCCU Stadium. Former St. Louis Rams head coach, Mike Martz, is the head coach of the team. San Diego has a long history of minor league ice hockey teams, starting with the San Diego Skyhawks that played in the Pacific Coast Hockey League from 1948 to 1950. Hockey returned in 1966 with the San Diego Gulls of the Western Hockey League, which were created by Robert Breitbard to have a tenant for his upcoming arena \u2013 now known as the Valley View Casino Center.

The Chargers were chosen by the league in 2016 as the second team to be allowed to relocate to Los Angeles with the Los Angeles Rams. Upon completion, both teams will play at Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, California after its expected completion in August 2020. Until then, the Chargers will reside at the StubHub Center in Carson, California. The Chargers transitioned from San Diego to new headquarters in the LA area throughout the offseason, although social and fan reaction was overwhelmingly negative. The team held their mini-camp in San Diego, with the final day on the field at the old practice field coming on June 15. Former players James Lofton, Nick Hardwick and Jacques Cesaire showed up on the final day, as did fans. Trucks moved equipment up the road after the final practice.

Defensive coordinator Gus Bradley opted to have Hayes Pullard remain as the starting middle linebacker after a promising performance during Perryman's absence.

In 2017 the Chargers moved back to their original city of Los Angeles, leaving San Diego without a professional football team for the first time since 1961. On May 29, 2018, the Alliance of American Football (AAF) announced they will start a franchise in San Diego, the San Diego Fleet, for their inaugural season in 2019. This franchise will play their home games at SDCCU Stadium. Former St. Louis Rams head coach, Mike Martz, is the head coach of the team. San Diego has a long history of minor league ice hockey teams, starting with the San Diego Skyhawks that played in the Pacific Coast Hockey League from 1948 to 1950. Hockey returned in 1966 with the San Diego Gulls of the Western Hockey League, which were created by Robert Breitbard to have a tenant for his upcoming arena \u2013 now known as the Valley View Casino Center. The Gulls soon grew a fanbase in San Diego, with averages of over 9,000 spectators.",

Spanos had a deadline of January 17, 2017, to decide if he wanted to return the team to Los Angeles. The Chargers were chosen by the league in 2016 as the second team to be allowed to relocate to Los Angeles with the Los Angeles Rams. Upon completion, both teams will play at Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, California after its expected completion in August 2020. Until then, the Chargers will reside at the StubHub Center in Carson, California. The Chargers transitioned from San Diego to new headquarters in the LA area throughout the offseason, although social and fan reaction was overwhelmingly negative. The team held their mini-camp in San Diego, with the final day on the field at the old practice field coming on June 15. Former players James Lofton, Nick Hardwick and Jacques Cesaire showed up on the final day, as did fans. Trucks moved equipment up the road after the final practice. Front office people continued to work in San Diego until the team's lease expired later in the summer. The team's new facility is in Costa Mesa, California.

On January 12, 2017, San Diego Chargers' owner Alex Spanos announced that the team planned to immediately return to Los Angeles for the 2017 season and return as the Los Angeles Chargers. Perryman entered training camp slated as the starting middle linebacker by head coach Anthony Lynn after defensive coordinator Gus Bradley switched the Chargers' defense to a base 4-3 defense that only requires one middle linebacker instead of two inside linebackers. On August 13, 2017, Perryman suffered a serious ankle injury that will require surgery during the Chargers' preseason-opener against the Seattle Seahawks and was expected to miss 6\u20138 weeks. On September 4, 2017, the Los Angeles Chargers officially placed Perryman on injured reserve. On November 7, 2017, he was activated off injured reserve to the active roster. On November 12, 2017, Perryman started his first game of the season at outside linebacker. Defensive coordinator Gus Bradley opted to have Hayes Pullard remain as the starting middle linebacker after a promising performance during Perryman's absence. Perryman went on to record a season-high ten combined tackles in his return, as the Chargers were defeated by the Jacksonville Jaguars 20-17.",
